The world was spinning around\nhim and he felt like vomiting. Each movement he made felt like a thousand\nneedles pricking his flesh.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It took him a while before he finally realized where he was\nand why. He felt sluggish and empty-headed. He was still on Talia's cold, stone\nfloor, but warm, soft blankets were laid over him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">And then he remembered Akir... </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade winced and tried to keep from crying, but it was\ninevitable. His mate was gone forever, and there was nothing he could do about\nit.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He thought more about what he did; he killed people.\nSoldiers as they were, they most likely had done nothing wrong... and he\nslaughtered them like animals. He nearly lost his own life in the process, and\nwhat good would that have done? He had been reckless.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">And Asha...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade whimpered, wishing he could hug his daughter right\nnow. He wanted to comfort her as he wrapped around her and tell her everything\nwas going to be okay, but he wasn't sure if that was true. Now that he had\nkilled palace guards, there was no way he could stay in the city any longer.\nThey would hunt him down and kill him just like they had killed Akir&#8212;if it was\neven them that had killed Blade's mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><i>Gods, why was I so\nstupid... </i>Blade clenched his teeth tightly and cried. He couldn't return to\nhis daughter. Blade was a risk to her life, and he couldn't bear the thought of\nher dying because of his mistakes. No, he could never be with Asha again...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade?\" Talia sat down on a stool next to him with a\nworried expression. Blood stained her ragged clothing.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sniffled and glanced up at her with wet eyes. \"I can't\never see m-my daughter again... I'll never see Akir again,\" he said hoarsely. He\npinched his eyes shut and whined. \"It hurts, Talia... G-gods, it hurts...\" He sobbed\nand clutched his chest with his paws. His emotional pain was much greater than\nhis physical pain, and his heart was hammering against his chest. Each pang\nfelt worse than the last.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What do you mean? What happened?\" she asked and lowered to\nher knees to rest a hand on his shoulder.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shivered and trembled. \"A-Akir is dead... I'm so lost.\nI-I don't know what to do. He's always... He's always been here for me.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Is he really... dead?\" she asked. She couldn't even believe\nit herself. Her lips trembled as she tried to think of something to say.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and sucked in a ragged breath. \"They killed\nhim.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm so... so, so sorry Blade...\" Her voice cracked and she\nturned her head away. \"Where's Asha?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and answered, \"She's with Vespera... safe.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia squeezed his shoulder and tried to comfort him. \"What\nhappened last night, Blade?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He grimaced and turned his head away. \"I-I don't want to\ntalk about it...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade,\" she pressed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A moment passed before he gave another sigh. \"I... I tried to\nattack the ruler... whoever that is.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You tried to attack the king?\" she asked incredulously.\n\"Why in the world would...\" Talia sighed too, seeming to have realized why he did\nit. \"You almost died, Blade.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I know...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That was stupid of you... Did you even think about what would\nhave happened to Asha if you died?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's face contorted as he nodded and elicited a soft\nwhimper. \"I did... I'm a terrible father. I- I abandoned her, just like my\nparents did with me. I'm... I'm no better than they are...\" He started to cry\nprofusely again.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade,\" she said softly, \"You can still see her again. It's\nnot over.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He shook his head and cried. \"I can't. I can't endanger her\nlike that. I can't see her... I can't see my own daughter ever again. I want her\nto be safe, s-so... I...\" He clenched his paws tightly until he drew blood with his\nclaws. \"I'm leaving her. I'm leaving the city.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade rolled onto his paws and struggled to stand up. His\nlimbs wanted to give out and his body complained with tremors of pain wracking\nhis entirety. He could hardly stand up, but he began to stumble toward the door\ndespite Talia's yelling.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade! You shouldn't be moving!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"The longer I-I stay here, the m-more likely you'll be in\nd-danger too,\" he said, struggling to even form his words.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You can hardly stand! Your wing his torn, you're injured,\nand your wounds will reopen if you fly!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade ignored her and opened the door. \"I... I need to bury\nAkir.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"If they catch you, Blade...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'll be fine.\" He looked back at Talia and flashed her a\nbrief and tiny smile. \"Thank you, Talia... for everything.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She nodded and wiped tears away from her eyes. He knew that\nif she could stop him she would; it hurt to see him go. \"Goodbye, Blade... Try to\ntake care of yourself. I-I'll keep an eye on Asha.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Hearing her say that warmed Blade's cold and broken heart.\nHe hobbled away and used almost all of the strength he had to take off.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The storm had cleared, leaving the fresh scent of fallen rain\nin the air. Overhanging clouds covered most of the sky, leaving a bleak, gray\nsheet over the world. But to Blade, his world was much, much darker.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade strained his wings and kept look out for any guards\nthat may notice him. He imagined that there were more wanted posters all over\nthe city by now, and there would no longer be a reward for bringing him in\nalive&#8212;only a reward for his head. Normally, Blade wouldn't have to worry about\nother ferals trying to claim that bounty, but if it was high enough pay... He\ndidn't want to think about that.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He angled down toward his home and checked for any potential\nthreats before roughly landing at the front of his house. Blade's heart caught\nin his chest as he saw Akir's body again. He could hardly bear the sight... but\nhe had to end this. He had to bury his mate's body.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Tears freely streamed down Blade's cheeks as he took a piece\nof broken stone and went around to the back of their house, away from any prying\neyes. Thankfully it wasn't all sand. After a layer of sand, Blade found dirt\nand started digging into it. He could hardly move, but he was determined to do\none last thing for Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia had been right, and Blade's wounds reopened. Blood\ndripped and soiled his feathers again, and his body trembled with pain. It felt\nlike agonizing hours had passed before he finally dug a big and deep enough\nhole.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade dragged Akir's body around to the back and collapsed\non top of it, sobbing profusely. For all of Blade's life, Akir had been there\nfor him. They spent almost every moment together... Now Blade felt alone&#8212;so very\nalone. Akir was everything to him, and his daughter had meant the world to him\ntoo.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Now, Blade had nothing.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He never realized until now what it truly felt like to feel\nempty. There was nothing left in the world for him. He had nowhere to go and no\nplace to be. He was lost.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After spending his last moments with Akir, Blade gently\nkissed his forehead and carefully lowered his body into the grave. He buried\nAkir and then lay down next to the grave until he cried himself to sleep.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Night had fallen when Blade woke up again. His body was even\nsorer than before, and his face felt like it had been beaten repeatedly. His\nnose was stuffed and his eyes didn't want to open, and his throat was dryer\nthan the sand.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shivered and curled up as tightly as he could, trying\nto use his feathers for warmth. They were all bloody and matted, so that hardly\nhelped. He was forced to get up, as difficult as it was, and find shelter\nsomewhere.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He couldn't ever step foot into their home again. There were\ntoo many memories there, and Blade was tired of crying. Tears wouldn't even\ncome out anymore. It hurt to cry, and he was tired of hurting. As far as he\ncould tell, there wasn't going to be an end to his pain. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He flew out of the city and away from the sea, going deeper\ninto the desert. The cold, night air numbed his body almost pleasantly, taking\naway a lot of the pain he felt. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After a while, he found a bunch of rocks jutting from the\nsandy earth. He landed as lightly as he could, but he still nearly toppled over\nand tripped over his paws. There wasn't much of a recess in the rocks, but he\nfound a big enough hole for him to crawl into. He spent the rest of his night\nthere, shivering and sulking before finally falling into a fitful slumber.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Day after day, Blade continued further and further away from\nthe city he once called home. He left everything he ever knew behind, since\nthere was nothing left for him anyway. His torturing thoughts never escaped him\nand stuck with him every wing beat of the way.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade couldn't stop thinking about Akir. More and more of\nhis happy memories faded away and were replaced with visions of Akir's beaten\nand bleeding body. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He hardly ate, and that was mostly because he didn't feel\nlike it. He drank enough water when he had the chance, but that was almost\neverything he had to sustain him. With no idea where to go, he just continued\nflying in one single direction, not caring whether he lived or died.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Now that he abandoned everything, Blade had nothing left to\nlive for.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Hunger pains gnawed at his stomach. Most of his smaller\nwounds had healed, but the major ones marred his body without much respite.\nSince he was starving, his body couldn't keep up with continually healing them\nas they reopened, so they mostly just stayed open, cracked and bleeding.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It finally came to the point that Blade was sure he was\ngoing to die. His mind was slow, his body was frail, and he could hardly stay\nawake even after he had slept for most of the day. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After the desert had ended, he found a dark-green forest,\nbut he felt too weak to even find a small rodent. He doubted he could have\ncaught it anyway. He just felt empty and very, very tired.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stopped in his tracks and wobbled in place for a\nmoment. He looked down at his paws and wondered why they wouldn't move, and\nthen he just collapsed. He croaked feebly and finally gave up. Blade accepted\nhis fate, shutting his eyes to think of his failure, how he never avenged his\nmate and ended up dead in the middle of nowhere.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><i>I'll see you soon, my\nlove...</i></span> </p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The thought of seeing his mate again put him at peace. With\na soft, gentle sigh, Blade smiled and let himself slip away.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What if he's completely feral! Ya know just as well as I do\nwe'll be his lunch when he wakes up. Look at 'im! He's all bone an' starving...\nWe're dead meat. I can't believe ya did this... Oh no, he's waking up!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade groaned and slowly opened his eyes, grimacing as he\nlooked around. He was inside a little wooden building, lying on his side across\na small bed of some sort. He saw one human run out of the house, and another\nstaring at him with wide, fearful eyes. New bandages covered his stinging wounds.\nBeside him was a big slab of meat, and the delicious scent of it assaulted his\nnostrils and sparked his instincts.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He immediately lunged and sank his teeth into the meat,\ngrowling viciously as he tore into it and nearly swallowed it whole. His eyes\ndarted around searching for more, and the human held out another thick piece.\nBlade ripped it from his hands and devoured that piece too. He lay back and\nsighed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">His head throbbed painfully and his body ached worse, but he\nwas still alive. Blade wondered how many times he had nearly died by now and\nfound it mildly amusing, but at the same time he wished that he would just die\nanyway. Life wasn't worth living anymore, and every day he had spent without\nAkir was just torture.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><br />\nAnd now that he didn't starve to death, he'd have to suffer even more. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Hello,\" the human said, \"my name is Riley.\" He was young\nand had a head full of black hair, and he wore animal skin for clothing instead\nof linens.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade opened and eye and stared at him. His first instinct\nwas to thank him, but he wasn't in the mood. He hated humans anyway, and he was\nsurprised that one of them would even consider helping a dragon.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Can you talk?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade just blinked at him. What dragon couldn't talk?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Well, okay... uhm... Just stay here and get some rest, I guess.\nI'll bring you more food.\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade watched him leave and then stood up. He still could\nhardly walk, but at least he could move. He opened the door and poked his head\nout. It looked like he was in a human village; there weren't any other ferals\nor even two-legs around, and everything looked pretty small.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He stumbled out and then hobbled away toward a line of\ntrees. No one seemed to notice him, and Blade was soon stepping through the\nforest to make his escape.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He didn't want a human's help, and he was rather annoyed\nthat one of them had saved his life. Even so, Blade had to admit that he was\nfeeling much better. Having food in his stomach was a welcoming feeling, and\nhis muscles thanked him for it. He hunted for more and pinned down another\nmeal: a small feline that got too curious and close to a big, hungry dragon.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had forgotten how hard it was to hunt for food. He\ncontinued looking around, but he scared almost every valuable target away. It\nwasn't long before he realized that it was probably because of his powerful,\ngrotesque scent that smelled of death. He hadn't bathed since that day... What\nhad it been, a month ago now?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Instead of looking for food, Blade listened for the sound of\nrunning water and eventually came upon a river deep in the wilderness. He\nshoved his face in the cold, refreshing water and drank nearly a full gallon\nbefore taking a breath.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He winced as he stepped into the rushing river, his feathers\nflaring out as the cold water seeped into his bones. He shivered and growled,\nbaring his fangs. The more his body was submerged, the more wounds the frigid\nwater covered. It took him a while to grow accustomed to such cold water, but\nthankfully he was able to stand at the bottom of the river and keep just his\nhead above the water.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">One good bath later and Blade felt rejuvenated. His mood\nwasn't any better, but his body thanked him greatly. Blood still stained his\nfeathers in some places, but he hoped that would wear off before long. He never\nliked being dirty, let alone looking completely ragged like a wild animal. The\ndrenched bandages didn't help either, but at least his wounds would probably\nheal faster with them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But now, that was all Blade was&#8212;a wild animal. He wandered west\naround the forest for months, finding more and more human camps similar to the\nfirst one he came across. Of course, he had no interest in them and found it\nvery annoying to constantly have to avoid the humans. Some of them were even\nbrave enough to attack Blade and hunt him as some sort of trophy, but he made\nquick work of them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">His wounds healed very slowly, but after a few months they\nhad healed to the point that he no longer ached. The only thing that hurt was\nhis heart.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade never forgot Akir, Asha, or Talia&#8212;even Vespera would\nhave been welcomed company. He longed for any sort of contact, to be back in\nthe city again. He felt so very alone, and being in this giant forest made him\nfeel completely isolated from the world, trapped in his own thoughts.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The first time Blade met someone else, he happened upon a\nreal, wild dragon. And that's all he was, a wild dragon. He spoke in a tongue\nBlade had never heard before and seemed very aggressive, so Blade kept his\ndistance and left, despite longing to stay with him for company.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The next time, Blade found a small city. He had wandered far\nenough through the forest that he came up to the other end of the continent,\nfinding himself on the western coast. This city was very small in comparison,\nbut Blade hoped that maybe this was where he could start a new life... a life\nwithout Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade flew down and landed in an empty area between some\nbuildings. He was immediately surprised not to feel his paws sifting through\nthe sand as he walked, but instead stepping on solid ground. This dirt road led\nto a bustling cobblestone road. His paws had already been sore from walking too\nmuch, and this rough, hard road certainly didn't help.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Unlike his old city, this one appeared to have almost as\nmany ferals as there were two-legs. Blade ambled down the busy street, noticing\na lot of feral dragons and gryphons mostly, but there were some wolves and\nfelines too. For being an outsider, he felt at bit more at ease to be with his\nown kind.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The majority of the buildings here were made out of wood\ninstead of stone and sandstone, and the architecture was different too. Instead\nof rounded corners and roofs, everything was blocky and cube-like. It even\nlooked like there were houses stacked on other houses, much like the area\nVespera lived in.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stopped in the center of a market, resting next to a\nfountain while crowds of people walked around him. It was loud and busy, just\nlike home.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade dipped his head into the fountain and took a drink,\nbut before he could finish a squawk sounded next to him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Gross! You drink that water? That's so gross, oh my\ngoodness,\" an orange-feathered gryphon said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade finished his drink and wiped his lips, staring sternly\nat him. The gryphon had dark-orange feathers on his front half and bright-orange\nfeathers on his lower half, but his underbelly was completely dark-gray. The\nsame charcoal color marked his face and body in blotchy designs as well as his\nfeline paws like socks. He stood about as tall as Blade's shoulders, like most\ngryphons.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What is gross?\" Blade asked gruffly. He was almost startled\nby his own voice. It was deeper than normal, a tad bit raspy, and it sounded\nlike he hadn't spoken in half a year... which was exactly true.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That!\" he squeaked, pointing at the fountain. \"That water's\nnot for drinking! I've had lots of baths in there, and I'm not the only one...\nbleegh...\" He made a weird face and grimaced. \"I can't believe you actually drank\nthat, you weirdo. You're not from around here, are you?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wore a frown and didn't really say much. This gryphon\nreminded him a lot about Vespera's talkative quirks, and those got on Blade's\nnerves quick.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"No...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The sunset-colored gryphon sat next to Blade on his haunches\nand cocked his head sideways. \"Where're you from then? And why are you so\ndirty? Why don't you take a bath while we talk!\" he offered and hopped into the\nfountain himself, splashing Blade with water.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grumbled quietly and thought about leaving... but this\nwas the first conversation he had since he left. He reluctantly climbed into\nthe fountain with the gryphon and tried to clean himself. It was rather hard to\ndo when there were so many eyes staring in their direction.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm from the east,\" Blade answered and ruffled his\nfeathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Really?\" he asked. \"There's nothing but human villages and\nwild ferals in the forest... You're not a wild dragon, are you?\" His purple eyes\nwidened at the possibility.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head. \"No...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Well, you certainly can't be from the desert! There's\nnothing there. Just a bunch of sand. I bet you're from the north! I don't know\nvery many northern dragons because I grew up in the south, but your feathers\nstill throw me for a loop. I've never seen a dragon with feathers before!\" he\nexclaimed almost too excitedly. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed. Even on the other side of the continent his\nspecies was very rare. He wondered if he'd ever meet another feathered dragon\nface-to-face.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"No, I'm from the east... from across the desert. I lived on\nthe other coast.\" Blade winced as he rubbed a big scar across his belly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"OH WOW, REALLY!?\" he squawked. \"That's so cool! I didn't\nknow that there were people living all the way over there. Oooooh, what was it\nlike? Are there other feather-dragons over there? Was there just sand all over\nthe place?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The gryphon's pure, genuine surprise almost startled Blade.\nHe pinned his ears back and shrugged his wings. \"I... uhm. I haven't met really\nany of my kind... But there was definitely a lot of sand.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The gryphon was literally wiggling with excitement. \"Cool,\ncool, cool! What about gryphons? Are there gryphons there too?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded. \"There are, yes.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That sounds like an amazing place! I bet the sun was really\nwarm... Oooh, I'd love to just lie on a rock all day and take it all in!\" The\npleasant look on his face was more than enough to tell Blade how delighted he\nwould have been.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why did you leave?\" the gryphon asked, perking his ears a\nlittle. He couldn't believe that Blade would leave such a paradise.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grumbled and turned his head away. \"I-I don't really\nwant to talk about that...\"He went to clean his shoulder and then hissed\npainfully. Despite having healed completely, it still from extremely tender and\nsore from where he was shot. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He noticed Blade's pain and curiously clacked his beak as he\ninspected it. Most of Blade's feathers had grown back, but they still couldn't\nhide the giant scar there.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Ouch! That must have hurt a lot... Wow, what is that from?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and tried to pet his feathers down now that he\nhad cleaned most of the grime from them. \"A gun.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What's a gun?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's uhm... a thing that goes <i>boom</i> and shoots rocks,\" Blade explained and climbed out of the\nfountain. Water dripped from his soaked feathers and dribbled onto the stone\nplaza.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh! You mean a cannon? WOW, how did you survive a CANNON!?\"\nHe hopped out too and then shook his body like a dog, spraying water droplets\neverywhere, even on those who were just walking by. They shot the both of them\nstrange looks, but otherwise continued on with their lives.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade winced, finding the gryphon to be too loud. He didn't\nlike other people hearing their conversation&#8212;especially if it meant him talking\nabout what happened that night. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"N-no... it was like a smaller cannon. Hand-sized.\" Blade\nlooked around, wondering if there was any way he could get away from this\ngryphon before he was sucked into something he didn't want to talk about.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, I see! You look like you've been in a war or something...\nIs that what happened? Is that why you're here now?\" he asked. His eyes were\nwide with a mixture of curiosity and awe.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade didn't think twice. \"Yes. I... uhm... fled.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I see, I see... That makes so much sense! You came quite a\nlong ways, though. Think you'll settle in here? It's a really nice city! I've\nlived here for about eight years now, and it's been really fun. Everyone here\nis so nice!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shuffled on his paws. \"I'm not really sure...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Well, let me show you around first!\" he squawked happily,\nalready leading Blade away from the fountain. \"My name is Renjee, by the way.\nWhat's yours, featherbutt?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade hesitated, but ultimately he thought it would be a\ngood idea to scope out the city. Maybe he could actually settle down here...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade,\" he answered and followed Renjee down a stone path\nthat cut away from the market.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Nice to meet you, Blade! That's a really cool name. You\nmust have had awesome parents!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade clenched his teeth and felt a nagging pain in his\nchest. Akir had been his parent... Talia, too, in his recent years. \"Y-yeah... I\ndid.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"My parents were pretty nice too, but they were B-O-R-I-N-G!\nStill, I should go visit them some time. They're probably worried sick about\nme!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wondered what it would be like to have actual parents,\nto have a home to go back to and someone worrying about him... He sighed and\nhoped that Talia and Asha were doing well. He missed them greatly. He wondered\nif Asha would miss her parents like he did when he was younger.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee led on, talking and blabbing about every little thing\nhe could find. The weird thing was&#8212;despite Blade's initial annoyance with the\ngryphon&#8212;was that he felt... comforted. To finally have someone to talk to was\nmore than enough, but constantly listening to Renjee distracted him from his\nthoughts. Blade hardly had time to think!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The city had a lot of unique qualities to it, though not as\nmany as Renjee thought there were. It was constructed on top of a large hill,\nso a lot of the buildings were built into the hillside. There was an\nunderground tunnel Renjee showed him that cut through the earth and opened up\nin three other entrances. It was a quicker means of travel for those who\ncouldn't fly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">They visited the sea, and it was colder here than on the\nother side of the continent. The smell of sea salt and brine was stronger too.\nMore ships filled the harbor, and Blade could watch them leaving and arriving\nin the distance, reminding him of his and Akir's little game.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Different from Blade's city, there didn't seem to be a\nseparation of the classes here. Everyone was equal as far as he could tell.\nWhen they walked through a richer housing district, Blade saw an almost even\nmixture of ferals and two-legs there. There weren't any specific races assigned\nto guard duty, either. In fact, there weren't very many human guards at all,\nlet alone humans in general. Blade liked that a lot.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">And when the sun began to set, Renjee led Blade to his house\nin a poorer district. To Blade, the citizens here were by no means poor. He\nknew what poverty truly was, and the people here were only mildly\ninconvenienced&#8212;though he never told Renjee that.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"This is it!\" Renjee said happily and opened his door for\nBlade. It was a wooden sliding door. \"Home sweet home.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stepped inside and immediately smelled the gryphon's\nstrong scent all over. The interior was a little cramped by the walls, but it\nwas still larger than Blade's old home. Alike Blade's home, there wasn't much\nfurniture; there were some beds lying around and then the usual containers for\nwater and food.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's not much, but it's enough for me!\" Renjee said happily\nand trotted into the next room just to flop on a bed. He wriggled around on his\nback and warbled with delight.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade bared a small smile and looked around. \"It is a nice\nhome,\" Blade complimented. \"Do you live alone?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee nodded. \"Thanks! You're welcome to stay here as long\nas you like. I haven't actually had anyone live with me before. There's more\nthan enough room, and I could use someone to talk to!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wondered how many more topics Renjee could even find\nto discuss. He was like an endless, jubilant orator. Blade wasn't sure how\nRenjee managed to convince him to stay the night, but it was probably the\nenticing warmth of having a bed to sleep on.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After finally telling Renjee that he needed his sleep, Blade\nslinked away into his own room and curled up on one of Renjee's many beds. He\ngroaned softly and fluffed up his feathers, his sore body almost shuddering\ndelightedly. It was such an amazing feeling to finally feel comfortable. Blade\nfell asleep almost instantly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade spent the next month with Renjee. The gryphon grew on\nhim, and Blade really liked spending time with him. It was a good distraction\naway from his torturing thoughts. Little by little his memories stopped\nhaunting him, and he started to forget the pain. He still missed Akir dearly\nand wished he could see Asha and Talia again, but it was comforting to know\nthat they were better off without him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee brought Blade to a few of his friends, and they all\nhad fairly uppity attitudes too; Blade was surprised that most of Renjee's\nfriends were dragons and not more gryphons. He liked a couple of them, but\nhaving more than one Renjee was a headache. Everyone seemed a lot happier here,\nand that raised Blade's spirits a little each day.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The more time Blade spent with Renjee, the more he really\nstarted to like him. Renjee was very kind and caring; he was very interested in\nwhat other's had to say too, not just himself. Blade opened up a little bit\nmore at a time, but he still kept why he left his old life behind a secret.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The next month, Blade was smiling more and more and getting\nmuch friendlier with Renjee. They'd go out together each day, find their food,\nplay around and talk, and then go back home to rest. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee didn't have much of a job, so Blade was going to\nteach him a few tricks about stealing, but the gryphon shook his head profusely\nand stated that he would never steal. And honestly, Blade didn't really want to\nsteal either, but he never thought about <i>not</i>\nstealing. They would occasionally find an odd job and do it to earn some extra\ncoin. That felt extremely odd to Blade, but very rewarding.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">For once in the last year, life was treating Blade much\nbetter. There were a few days that he'd get all mopey, but Renjee was there to\nhelp him. But the worst day had yet to come.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade realized that it was nearly a year later since that\nnight. He had been away from home for so long that he thought he was feeling\nhomesick, but Blade felt worse than that. His stomach twisted and turned all\nday, despite Renjee trying to comfort him. The pain was creeping back into his\nbones, and his thoughts were in dark places.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade pulled Renjee against him, hugging and wrapping his\npaws around the smaller gryphon while they cuddled in the same bed. Recently,\nthis was how they slept together, sharing their warmth as the cold winter came\nupon them. Blade had no idea that other places of the world went through\nseasons and found it rather fascinating, but at the same time he missed the\nwarmth of the sun against his feathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee was so soft and huggable that Blade couldn't resist\nsqueezing on him and nuzzling into his warm feathers. He realized Akir must\nhave felt the same with Blade...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed. Renjee twined their tails together and looked\nup at Blade with a quiet warble.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What's wrong, Blade? You've been acting like a grump-butt\ntoday,\" Renjee said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I don't know... I'm just not feeling well.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why? Are you sick? This time of the year, a lot of people\nget sick... But... What's on your mind?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade winced and shrugged his shoulders. He had told Renjee\na lot of what actually happened that night, but he had never told him the whole\ntruth; he wasn't sure if he could handle telling him without breaking down\ncompletely.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Is it about those people you killed?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade frowned and shook his head. \"I probably just need some\nrest.\" Now he sounded like Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee turned around in Blade's embrace so they lay\ntogether, belly to belly. He looked into Blade's golden eyes with wide,\nsincere, purple spheres and gently pet the soft feathers puffing out at his\nchest. A warm smile cracked his beak.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Well, maybe I have an idea that will help you feel better!\nB-but uhm&#8212;are you uhm&#8212;Do you like other males?\" Renjee looked up at Blade\nbashfully with his feathers all puffed out around his head. \"I've been wanting\nto ask you that.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed a little. Renjee didn't know about his\nrelationship with Akir. Blade had thought about mating with Renjee plenty, but\nhe had never been sure with himself. He wasn't ready to move on... No... He wasn't\nsure if he would ever be ready. But the warm thought of sharing intimate\nrelations with someone else again... Gods, he needed that pleasure, and it would\nreally help him feel better right now.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade took the initiative and dipped his forepaw between the\ngryphon's legs, finding his plump orbs and thick sheath. He took them in his\npaw and rubbed around in circles as a small smile spread his lips. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee squawked as his feathers flared out. His eyes shut\nand his tongue lolled out. \"Oooh gods, Blaaaade!\" The gryphon spread his legs\nopen and buried his beak into Blade's chest, warbling and cooing with delight.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gulped and felt uncertain, but he kept going. He could\nfeel Renjee's sheath already stirring, thickening up and swelling just before\nhis pink, tapered tip poked out of it. Blade grabbed his orbs and gently\nsqueezed them and rolled them around in his paw while he looked down and\nwatched the gryphon's cock grow.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Getting Renjee worked up made Blade get all worked up. He\nhadn't felt any sexual stimulation in so long...\nHis length grew quickly and his mind fogged over with lust.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It happened so fast that all of these memories started to\nplay through Blade's mind&#8212;memories about mating with Akir that Blade had locked\naway until now. All of those wonderful times they spent together...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee stood up and raised his rump and tail high into the\nair, waiting for Blade to mount him. Blade stared blankly ahead, hesitating\nwith each and every step while his heart throbbed almost painfully in his\nchest. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">His body craved this; it wanted to satisfy all of his\npent-up desires. Staring beneath the gryphon's tail roused so many lustful\nfeelings inside him, but Blade couldn't think straight. It wasn't Renjee that\nhe was seeing, no&#8212;it was Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He remembered his and Akir's first time together. He\nremembered how much they had loved each other, and how much of that love had\ngone into their mating. He remembered what Akir felt like and how he looked\nwhen he was pleasured. And Blade remembered what it felt like to have Akir\npleasure him...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade felt tears suddenly spill from his eyes and run down\nhis cheeks. He'd never be able to feel that pleasure again... No, he couldn't. As\nmuch as he liked Renjee, Blade couldn't say that he loved him. It was too soon\nfor that... And he couldn't betray Akir so soon. They had spent so, so many years\ntogether. What they had was more than love; it was a deep-rooted bond they\nbuilt from spending their entire lives together. Blade had only known Renjee\nfor maybe half of a year</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><i>What was I thinking? </i>Blade\nsniffled and whimpered, shutting his eyes as memories of Akir flooded him. His\nbreathing grew ragged as he started to sob uncontrollably. He leaned to the\nside and nearly fell over.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"B-Blade? Blade, what's wrong? D-did I do something wrong?\nDid you not want this?\" Renjee licked and nuzzled Blade affectionately, trying\nhis best to comfort the dragon. But Blade was lost in his own mind; he hardly\nnoticed Renjee there.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He tried to wipe his eyes, but his tears kept pouring out.\nAll of the sadness he had locked away broke free, filling him with sorrow. He\nwas so close to being happy again... so close to being like himself&#8212;but Blade\nrealized he would never be the same again.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When Akir had died, he had died too.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm... I'm so s-sorry, Renjee,\" Blade sobbed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's okay, Blade! C'mon, let's just lie down. We don't have\nto mate. I just thought you might like it.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head and clenched his teeth. \"I-I can't... I\nhave to go... I... I need to go home.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee warbled sadly and looked at Blade with a hurt\nexpression. \"What do you mean? I... I thought you liked it here... Blade?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm sorry, Renjee,\" Blade said and felt like a sword had\nlodged itself in his chest. He hurt again. That same, agonizing pain returned.\nBlade coughed and clutched his chest before whirling around and running out of\nthe house. Renjee called after him, but Blade was out of the door and in the\nsky in seconds.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Seeing Renjee hurt like that... Blade couldn't bear the sight.\nHe never wanted that to happen. Renjee would be better off without Blade too. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The world was better off without Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade flew directly east for as long as he could until his\nwings were nearly ready to fall off. Again, he was leaving behind everything,\nbut this time he wasn't going to start over elsewhere. It was going to end\nwhere it began.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It took Blade nearly a full month of straight flying to\nfinally see the desert again. Sand dunes rolled over the landscape for nearly\nas far as he could see. Before he continued, he stopped to rest and take a big\ndrink of water as well as find his last meal before making his trek over the\ndesert.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade was much more prepared this time, and he wasn't\nhalf-dead either, so he flew through the cool breeze of the night and made a\nconsiderable distance. By the next day, the city was in sight.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade didn't think about how badly his wings hurt. There\nwere too many thoughts running through his mind, too many memories that he was\ndrowning in. Everything looked exactly the same, the sun felt the same, and the\nair was the same. Life continued on without him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade dipped down from the sky and flew to the market\ndistrict, toward an herb shop that Talia had told him to get supplies from\nbefore. He landed in the market area, finding a familiar sense of belonging as\nhe was surrounded by people that he used to recognize. He worried for a moment\nthat someone would recognize him, as he was sure that if he was caught he would\nbe attacked and killed on sight. But Blade realized that he didn't care.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He walked into the herb shop and approached the old fox lady\nwith a glaring expression. \"I need a vial of dragonsroot oil.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She regarded him with a curt response and retrieved what he\nasked for. \"This isn't easy to come by. Two gold coins.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled and bared his fangs, reaching out his paw.\n\"Give it to me.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She gave it to him, but she didn't show a single shred of\nfear in her eyes. \"What are you going to use it for?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade took it and shivered, ignoring her question. \"Thank\nyou,\" he said and walked out. He took off into the air, clutching the vial in\nhis paw. He looked at it momentarily and felt his gut twist uncomfortably as he\nstared at the strange, light-brown liquid. Just one drop of this would burn his\nflesh intensely... He wondered how much pain he would experience swallowing it\nall.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">With the tilt of his wings, Blade glided down to his old\nhome. He had told himself he'd never come back here, but he wanted to see it\nall one last time before he went to see Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When Blade stepped inside, his heart beat against his chest\nlike a hammer. He could hardly breathe, and his eyes were tearing up. It was\nstill abandoned, and it looked like it had never changed. Blood stains still\nsplattered the floor and wooden pieces were scattered all over.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade looked around, crying and just letting his emotions\nseep out of him. He walked into their bedroom and remembered when they first\nput that bed in. Their first night together on it... Blade whimpered and buried\nhis nose into the fur sheets, trying to smell Akir's scent again. And for a\nbrief, blissful second, he thought he did,\nbut it was his imagination.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Everything smelled old and dusty, and their home looked like\nit was ravaged. Nothing was what it used to be.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's satchel was still left where he threw it, and he checked\nto see if there were still any coins left in it. There weren't any left in the\nexterior pouch, but he was unpleasantly surprised to see the decayed remains of\nthe fruit he had bought a year ago. The golden band that he had bought for Akir\nwas still there, left in an interior pouch. Scavengers must not have checked\nthrough the foul-smelling, rotting fruit.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grabbed it and held it in his paw, smiling softly as\nhe imagined Akir wearing the earring. He set it down on the floor in front of\nhim and looked at the vial, feeling his heart racing in his chest. Blade\nfrowned and sniffed, uncertain. Was this really the end? </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After all of his pain and anguish, would killing himself\nreally free him? What if the afterlife was real? Would he see Akir there? Was\nAkir waiting for him? Blade sniffled and started to sob harder. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He missed Akir so much... He couldn't bear life without his\nmate. He tried to go alone and he failed. He came crawling back right to where\nit all ended, where his and Akir's life had ended. He wished he could go back\nto how things were before, but everything would soon come to an end.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade thought about Asha and felt like he was stabbed in the\ngut. He was a failure, no matter how he looked at it. His mate died because he\ncouldn't protect him and he abandoned his daughter because he couldn't control\nhimself. And Talia... He would be a disappointment to her. She saved him on more\nthan one occasion, and now he was just going to throw his life away.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><i>Are you waiting for\nme, Akir? </i>Blade uncorked the cap to the vial and felt himself shaking. His\nwings trembled at his sides and his tail swished back and forth. He thought about\nRenjee and how he had just left his new friend and abandoned him too. If Renjee\nfound out Blade was dead... That didn't matter. Blade would be dead, and he\nwouldn't have to worry about anything anymore. He could be with his mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm coming, Akir,\" Blade said softly. He tried to think\nabout the good times he had with his mate, and a small smile curled his lips\nwhile tears continued to fall. He remembered when they had first met, how Akir\nsaved his life...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Sudden warmth filled him, residing mostly in his chest while\nit flowed like water through the rest of his body. It was so calming and\nnurturing that it felt like Akir was wrapping him in the warmest of embraces,\nwhispering softly into his ear and telling him everything was going to be okay.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade winced and sighed. He remembered how Akir took such\nloving care of him. He nurtured and raised Blade, taught him valuable lessons,\nand made him who he was today. Akir devoted his entire life to loving Blade.\nFrom the first day he met Blade to his very last, Akir was there for Blade,\nprotecting him. And even now, it felt like Akir was still here with him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir didn't want Blade to die. Blade didn't want to die.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade cried out and dropped the vial away from him, the\nglass shattering and spilling the lethal liquid over the ground. He clutched\nhis stomach and felt onto his side, crying profusely. Akir didn't want him to\ndie.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Beautiful memories washed over Blade as he sobbed\nuncontrollably. He remembered when Akir first said 'I love you' to him as a\nmate. Old, familiar feelings welled inside Blade, taking away the pain and\nagony he had felt for the last year. He was filled instead with joy. To know\nthat Akir loved him warmed Blade's heart, and if Akir was truly waiting for\nhim, he would want Blade to live a full life before coming to see him again. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir would want Blade to be happy.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><i>I will wait for you,\nBlade, and I will be with you every step of the way&#8212;until we see each other\nagain.</i></span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade lay there for hours, crying and reminiscing about all\nof his happiest memories. Most of his pain finally disappeared, leaving him\nrelieved. He stood up on trembling legs and looked around one last time. He\nthought about visiting Talia before he left again and figured that it wouldn't\nhurt to see his old friend. He thought about visiting Vespera and Asha too... but\nhe knew he shouldn't.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade found Asha's toy dragon next to her broken crib and\nfelt a twinge of pain. He wanted so badly to see how Asha had grown and to be a\npart of her life again, but Blade was still a danger to her here. If he could\njust take her with him... Blade sighed and clenched his teeth. He couldn't do\nthat to Vespera, to take away her daughter again after they had already bonded.\nVespera had a life here, so she couldn't just leave it behind either.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and started to walk out after grabbing the\nearring and Asha's toy, but then something caught his eye. It was a few pieces\nof paper sticking out of their old furs. He hadn't noticed those before, and he\nquickly went to grab them. He stared at the scribbled runes and sifted through\nthem, but Blade didn't know how to read. It looked like a letter of sorts, and\nthere was a heart at the end of it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><i>Akir...</i> Blade folded\nthe paper neatly and tucked it close to him as he quickly padded out of the\nhouse and took off toward Talia. His wings felt so very sore, but he winced\nthrough the pain and flew as fast as he could. He landed directly outside of\nTalia's home and pounded on her door.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia opened it and looked very surprised to see Blade.\nBlade smiled warmly at her and immediately hugged around her with his wings.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade...\" She squeezed him back and invited him inside,\nquickly shutting the door behind him. \"I've been so worried about you.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and sheepishly pawed at the ground. \"It's been...\nrough,\" he stated, not wanting to tell Talia any details. \"But I feel... much\nbetter. A lot better.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm glad, Blade. I've missed seeing you around all the\ntime.

Talia grinned widely at\nhim and sat down in her chair while he lay down next to her, handing her the\npapers. He held Asha's toy in front of him and set the earring down, smiling\nsoftly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What's this?\" she asked, looking through them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrugged his wings. \"I was hoping you could read them\nto me.

I think Akir wrote them, but I can't read.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"He never taught you to read?\" Talia asked with disbelief.\n\"That foolish sack of sca&#8212;...

His heart thrummed excitedly\nwhile his tail swished behind him. He wanted to know what Akir wrote. He wondered\nwhy Akir hadn't shown him the letters before, but it must have been something\nhe had been waiting for.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She nodded. \"<i>To Blade,\nthe love of my life: I'm so sorry.

He clenched his paws tightly and\nburied his face under a wing, sniffling and sobbing quietly. He could hear\nTalia's voice cracking and breaking too while she read, and she sniffled almost\nas often as he did.

I wanted to build a better future for our family, and I\nhad been so close to achieving that dream.

There were so many memories brought back to life by that letter, and\nhe could practically hear it all in Akir's voice.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir had known that he would die. He sacrificed himself so\nBlade and Asha would have better lives without him, and Blade nearly threw that\nall away.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why... Why didn't he try to run? We could have left... We could\nhave been safe somewhere else...\" Blade said, musing over other outcomes. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia sniffled and sighed, setting the letter down beside\nher. \"Akir was smart, Blade. I'm sure he thought about that. He wanted you and\nAsha to be safe, and whoever was after him would have probably hunted him down.\nIt's how you feel about Asha, you know.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded in understanding and clenched his talons\ntogether tightly. \"I wish he would have told me... but he was right. I would have\ntried to protect him, and I would have died with him...\" Blade sighed and teared\nup again. \"I loved him so much.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I know, Blade,\" Talia said and stroked the back of his neck\ngently. \"But you're alive now, and that's all that matters.\" Her finger traced\nover one of his scars. \"You've gone through a lot... Why don't you find somewhere\nto settle down that's far, far away?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and stood up, grabbing Asha's toy and the ring.\n\"I have somewhere already, and someone I should be with. I should have just\nstayed there, but I'm glad I didn't. Thank you for reading those to me, Talia.\nIt... It means a lot.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Of course, Blade,\" Talia said softly and handed the papers\nto him. \"Take these, Blade. Even if you can't read, you'll want them.\" She\nstood up and hugged around him again. \"Try to learn to read, alright? It's\npretty important.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade chuckled and nodded, nuzzling her affectionately. \"Thanks\nfor being here for me.

Just... don't be surprised if I'm not\nhere the next time you come.\" Talia looked at him kindly and stroked between\nhis horns.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's expression softened as he nodded. \"I understand.\nTake care, Talia. I'll miss you.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia smiled and opened the door for Blade. \"I'll miss you\ntoo. Goodbye, Blade.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The door shut behind him, leaving Blade in a slight daze. So\nmuch had happened and he hardly any time to sift through it. He shook his body\nand fluffed up his feathers, trying to feel just a little bit more normal\nagain. He took off and flew towards the coast, quickly coming upon that cave he\nand Akir lived at long ago.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It was cold and dank inside, and a lot smaller than what he\nremembered. He found the wooden toy gryphon Blade had given Akir. He had found\nit outside the city one day, completely abandoned. Blade smiled and moved it to\nthe side as he dug into the ground. His claws soon scraped a wooden trunk, so\nBlade dug around it and was eventually able to lift it up; it was very heavy.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grunted and set it down, opening it to find more shiny\nthings than he could have ever imagined. Jewels and gold brimmed the very top\nof it, and then Blade realized that there was another similar trunk beneath\nthat. His golden eyes widened as he pawed through some of it, utterly amazed.\nThere was no way he could carry all of this!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Thankfully, Akir had smartly set aside four different\nsatchels. Blade stuffed two of them with as much as he could carry and flew\nback toward the city. His wings hurt badly, but he couldn't help but to smile.\nHe stopped at Talia's house again and set one of the satchels down. He knocked\nloudly on her door and quickly took off.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He leapt into the sky and flew toward the feral district. He\nlanded for a moment at Vespera's door and set down the other satchel with Asha's\nold toy inside, hoping that it would find its way to his daughter. He deeply\nwished that he could tell her how much he loved her and hoped that she would\ngrow up the way he had imagined. He wished he could give her one big hug and\ntell her that he was sorry... But it was best for her to never see him again. At\nleast now he knew she would have a better life&#8212;and Vespera too.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sniffled and took off again after knocking on the door,\nthis time back toward the coast. He clutched Akir's earring in his paw and\nthought about Renjee. He hoped he could return to the gryphon and apologize\nprofusely for leaving him like that. He hoped that Renjee didn't move on\nalready too. Blade would have been missing for almost two months by the time he\nreturned.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He stopped back at the cave and filled only one satchel\nhalfway this time and stuffed Akir's letter and ring inside. He buried the two\ntrunks again, having hardly made a dent in the first one, and tried to wipe any\nevidence of him being here away. If he ever needed money again, he could return\nhere. Then he took off again and flew west.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed, feeling his aching wings struggling to carry\nhim as he flew past the city. He wouldn't be able to fly as recklessly as\nbefore, and it would probably be longer than a month until he saw Renjee again.\n</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But then he heard a familiar squawk come from above him as a\nfeathered mass nearly tumbled into Blade. Blade yelped and caught Renjee,\nstraining his wings even more as he held tightly to him. Renjee was panting and\ntrembling, his wings drooping listlessly at his sides. Blade flew down to a\nsand dune and propped the gryphon up on his haunches.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Renjee!?\" Blade hugged around him tightly with his wings,\nenveloping the soft gryphon in a warm embrace.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"O-ohmygosh... You're so... so fast... how... how did you keep\nflying like... that... Gods, my wings hurt. Out... of breath...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee looked completely exhausted. His sunset-colored\nfeathers were all ruffled, his eyes could hardly stay open, and his wings\ndidn't look like they could move much more. He swayed back and forth as he sat\nup, unable to keep his balance. \"You... followed me all the way here?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee warbled affirmatively and collapsed into Blade's\narms. \"M-mostly... Bleeergh, I think I'm going to vomit. O-oh... yup.\" Renjee broke\naway for a moment and heaved away from Blade, making the dragon grimace and\nturn his nose away.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You didn't have to do that...\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee finished and shivered, returning back to Blade's arms.\nIt looked like he had caught his breath too, but Blade could feel his heart\nrapidly beating against him. \"I did! I was worried about you. You looked really\nsad, and I didn't want to see you sad. But wow, you're a really good flier. I\nthought I was good, but jeeze... I don't think I can fly anymore!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and squeezed Renjee tightly against him. \"You'll\nrecover. I... I brought you something,\" Blade said and opened up the satchel to\ntake the ring in his paw. The golden earring rested on a paw pad. \"Do you wear\nearrings?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee's purple eyes brightened as he looked at it. He\nnodded and let Blade hook it through a hole that was already near the base of\nhis left ear. \"I used to wear one before I met you, but I lost it. Thanks,\nBlade,\" he said and licked Blade's nose. \"Where'd you get this?\" He cocked his\nhead at the satchel Blade wore.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It was... a gift for someone very dear to me. I'll uhm... tell\nyou about it later,\" Blade said and smiled softly. Renjee did look very\nhandsome, and that earring complimented his orange colors well. Blade chuckled\nand set the satchel down in front of him. \"But this is for us!\" He opened the\nflap and showed Renjee the pile of luxuries inside.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He doubted Renjee had ever seen so much gold before with the\nway his eyes widened and feathers puffed out. \"Y-you didn't steal this, did\nyou!? That's so much gold!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head, but quickly realized that Akir\ndefinitely did have a part in stealing all of this in some way. \"No, it was a\ngift from that same someone that was very close to me.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Was he a king!? Wow! We won't ever have to work again,\"\nRenjee said happily. Blade imagined he'd be dancing around if he weren't so\ntired. \"But if he's so special to you... then why are you coming back with me?\"\nRenjee asked curiously.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade pinned his ears back. \"He's not with us anymore...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, I'm sorry, Blade,\" Renjee said and nuzzled him back,\ntrying to comfort him. \"He must have been really amazing.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's fine. I think I'm finally over it... I feel a lot\nbetter,\" Blade said and smiled. He looked into Renjee's eyes and felt much\ncalmer than he had before. He doubted that Renjee could ever replace Akir, but\nit was a start.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why don't we take our time heading back home?\" Blade asked\nand playfully booped the gryphon. \"You need to rest your wings anyway.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee squawked and booped back. \"Just not too long! I don't\nwant my friends to worry about me missing. It's already been a month... Wow, you\nreally do live on the other coast! I saw the ocean and it looked so blue!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and started to walk across the sand.\nTruthfully, he thought he'd miss feeling it squish beneath his paws, but he\nlooked forward to getting away from it for a while. Renjee squeaked and followed\nnext to Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Where are you going?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrugged his wings and kept walking. \"We have to make\ntime when we can, right? Besides, I'd like to talk to you about some stuff, and\nit's hard to talk when you're flying.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Renjee nodded and looked up at Blade. \"What do you want to\ntalk about?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade looked back and smiled warmly. \"I'd like to tell you\nabout my life, the important stuff I've left out...

    "content": "AFTER THE STORM\n\nWhen Blade opened his eyes again, his head throbbed and his body ached from his\nsnout to the tip of his tail. The world was spinning around him and he felt like\nvomiting. Each movement he made felt like a thousand needles pricking his flesh.\n\nIt took him a while before he finally realized where he was and why. He felt\nsluggish and empty-headed. He was still on Talia's cold, stone floor, but warm,\nsoft blankets were laid over him.\n\nAnd then he remembered Akir...\n\nBlade winced and tried to keep from crying, but it was inevitable. His mate was\ngone forever, and there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nHe thought more about what he did; he killed people. Soldiers as they were, they\nmost likely had done nothing wrong... and he slaughtered them like animals. He\nnearly lost his own life in the process, and what good would that have done? He\nhad been reckless.\n\nAnd Asha...\n\nBlade whimpered, wishing he could hug his daughter right now. He wanted to\ncomfort her as he wrapped around her and tell her everything was going to be\nokay, but he wasn't sure if that was true. Now that he had killed palace guards,\nthere was no way he could stay in the city any longer. They would hunt him down\nand kill him just like they had killed Akir—if it was even them that had killed\nBlade's mate.\n\nGods, why was I so stupid... Blade clenched his teeth tightly and cried. He\ncouldn't return to his daughter. Blade was a risk to her life, and he couldn't\nbear the thought of her dying because of his mistakes. No, he could never be\nwith Asha again...\n\n\"Blade?\" Talia sat down on a stool next to him with a worried expression. Blood\nstained her ragged clothing.\n\nBlade sniffled and glanced up at her with wet eyes. \"I can't ever see m-my\ndaughter again... I'll never see Akir again,\" he said hoarsely. He pinched his\neyes shut and whined. \"It hurts, Talia... G-gods, it hurts...\" He sobbed and\nclutched his chest with his paws. His emotional pain was much greater than his\nphysical pain, and his heart was hammering against his chest. Each pang felt\nworse than the last.\n\n\"What do you mean? What happened?\" she asked and lowered to her knees to rest a\nhand on his shoulder.\n\nBlade shivered and trembled. \"A-Akir is dead... I'm so lost. I-I don't know what\nto do. He's always... He's always been here for me.\"\n\n\"Is he really... dead?\" she asked. She couldn't even believe it herself. Her\nlips trembled as she tried to think of something to say.\n\nBlade nodded and sucked in a ragged breath. \"They killed him.\"\n\n\"I'm so... so, so sorry Blade...\" Her voice cracked and she turned her head\naway. \"Where's Asha?\"\n\nBlade sighed and answered, \"She's with Vespera... safe.\"\n\nTalia squeezed his shoulder and tried to comfort him. \"What happened last night,\nBlade?\"\n\nHe grimaced and turned his head away. \"I-I don't want to talk about it...\"\n\n\"Blade,\" she pressed.\n\nA moment passed before he gave another sigh. \"I... I tried to attack the\nruler... whoever that is.\"\n\n\"You tried to attack the king?\" she asked incredulously. \"Why in the world\nwould...\" Talia sighed too, seeming to have realized why he did it. \"You almost\ndied, Blade.\"\n\n\"I know...\"\n\n\"That was stupid of you... Did you even think about what would have happened to\nAsha if you died?\"\n\nBlade's face contorted as he nodded and elicited a soft whimper. \"I did... I'm a\nterrible father. I- I abandoned her, just like my parents did with me. I'm...\nI'm no better than they are...\" He started to cry profusely again.\n\n\"Blade,\" she said softly, \"You can still see her again. It's not over.\"\n\nHe shook his head and cried. \"I can't. I can't endanger her like that. I can't\nsee her... I can't see my own daughter ever again. I want her to be safe,\ns-so... I...\" He clenched his paws tightly until he drew blood with his claws.\n\"I'm leaving her. I'm leaving the city.\"\n\nBlade rolled onto his paws and struggled to stand up. His limbs wanted to give\nout and his body complained with tremors of pain wracking his entirety. He could\nhardly stand up, but he began to stumble toward the door despite Talia's\nyelling.\n\n\"Blade! You shouldn't be moving!\"\n\n\"The longer I-I stay here, the m-more likely you'll be in d-danger too,\" he\nsaid, struggling to even form his words.\n\n\"You can hardly stand! Your wing his torn, you're injured, and your wounds will\nreopen if you fly!\"\n\nBlade ignored her and opened the door. \"I... I need to bury Akir.\"\n\n\"If they catch you, Blade...\"\n\n\"I'll be fine.\" He looked back at Talia and flashed her a brief and tiny smile.\n\"Thank you, Talia... for everything.\"\n\nShe nodded and wiped tears away from her eyes. He knew that if she could stop\nhim she would; it hurt to see him go. \"Goodbye, Blade... Try to take care of\nyourself. I-I'll keep an eye on Asha.\"\n\nHearing her say that warmed Blade's cold and broken heart. He hobbled away and\nused almost all of the strength he had to take off.\n\nThe storm had cleared, leaving the fresh scent of fallen rain in the air.\nOverhanging clouds covered most of the sky, leaving a bleak, gray sheet over the\nworld. But to Blade, his world was much, much darker.\n\nBlade strained his wings and kept look out for any guards that may notice him.\nHe imagined that there were more wanted posters all over the city by now, and\nthere would no longer be a reward for bringing him in alive—only a reward for\nhis head. Normally, Blade wouldn't have to worry about other ferals trying to\nclaim that bounty, but if it was high enough pay... He didn't want to think\nabout that.\n\nHe angled down toward his home and checked for any potential threats before\nroughly landing at the front of his house. Blade's heart caught in his chest as\nhe saw Akir's body again. He could hardly bear the sight... but he had to end\nthis. He had to bury his mate's body.\n\nTears freely streamed down Blade's cheeks as he took a piece of broken stone and\nwent around to the back of their house, away from any prying eyes. Thankfully it\nwasn't all sand. After a layer of sand, Blade found dirt and started digging\ninto it. He could hardly move, but he was determined to do one last thing for\nAkir.\n\nTalia had been right, and Blade's wounds reopened. Blood dripped and soiled his\nfeathers again, and his body trembled with pain. It felt like agonizing hours\nhad passed before he finally dug a big and deep enough hole.\n\nBlade dragged Akir's body around to the back and collapsed on top of it, sobbing\nprofusely. For all of Blade's life, Akir had been there for him. They spent\nalmost every moment together... Now Blade felt alone—so very alone. Akir was\neverything to him, and his daughter had meant the world to him too.\n\nNow, Blade had nothing.\n\nHe never realized until now what it truly felt like to feel empty. There was\nnothing left in the world for him. He had nowhere to go and no place to be. He\nwas lost.\n\nAfter spending his last moments with Akir, Blade gently kissed his forehead and\ncarefully lowered his body into the grave. He buried Akir and then lay down next\nto the grave until he cried himself to sleep.\n\nNight had fallen when Blade woke up again. His body was even sorer than before,\nand his face felt like it had been beaten repeatedly. His nose was stuffed and\nhis eyes didn't want to open, and his throat was dryer than the sand.\n\nBlade shivered and curled up as tightly as he could, trying to use his feathers\nfor warmth. They were all bloody and matted, so that hardly helped. He was\nforced to get up, as difficult as it was, and find shelter somewhere.\n\nHe couldn't ever step foot into their home again. There were too many memories\nthere, and Blade was tired of crying. Tears wouldn't even come out anymore. It\nhurt to cry, and he was tired of hurting. As far as he could tell, there wasn't\ngoing to be an end to his pain.\n\nHe flew out of the city and away from the sea, going deeper into the desert. The\ncold, night air numbed his body almost pleasantly, taking away a lot of the pain\nhe felt.\n\nAfter a while, he found a bunch of rocks jutting from the sandy earth. He landed\nas lightly as he could, but he still nearly toppled over and tripped over his\npaws. There wasn't much of a recess in the rocks, but he found a big enough hole\nfor him to crawl into. He spent the rest of his night there, shivering and\nsulking before finally falling into a fitful slumber.\n\n* * *\n\nDay after day, Blade continued further and further away from the city he once\ncalled home. He left everything he ever knew behind, since there was nothing\nleft for him anyway. His torturing thoughts never escaped him and stuck with him\nevery wing beat of the way.\n\nBlade couldn't stop thinking about Akir. More and more of his happy memories\nfaded away and were replaced with visions of Akir's beaten and bleeding body.\n\nHe hardly ate, and that was mostly because he didn't feel like it. He drank\nenough water when he had the chance, but that was almost everything he had to\nsustain him. With no idea where to go, he just continued flying in one single\ndirection, not caring whether he lived or died.\n\nNow that he abandoned everything, Blade had nothing left to live for.\n\nHunger pains gnawed at his stomach. Most of his smaller wounds had healed, but\nthe major ones marred his body without much respite. Since he was starving, his\nbody couldn't keep up with continually healing them as they reopened, so they\nmostly just stayed open, cracked and bleeding.\n\nIt finally came to the point that Blade was sure he was going to die. His mind\nwas slow, his body was frail, and he could hardly stay awake even after he had\nslept for most of the day.\n\nAfter the desert had ended, he found a dark-green forest, but he felt too weak\nto even find a small rodent. He doubted he could have caught it anyway. He just\nfelt empty and very, very tired.\n\nBlade stopped in his tracks and wobbled in place for a moment. He looked down at\nhis paws and wondered why they wouldn't move, and then he just collapsed. He\ncroaked feebly and finally gave up. Blade accepted his fate, shutting his eyes\nto think of his failure, how he never avenged his mate and ended up dead in the\nmiddle of nowhere.\n\nI'll see you soon, my love...\n\nThe thought of seeing his mate again put him at peace. With a soft, gentle sigh,\nBlade smiled and let himself slip away.\n\n* * *\n\n\"What if he's completely feral! Ya know just as well as I do we'll be his lunch\nwhen he wakes up. Look at 'im! He's all bone an' starving... We're dead meat. I\ncan't believe ya did this... Oh no, he's waking up!\"\n\nBlade groaned and slowly opened his eyes, grimacing as he looked around. He was\ninside a little wooden building, lying on his side across a small bed of some\nsort. He saw one human run out of the house, and another staring at him with\nwide, fearful eyes. New bandages covered his stinging wounds. Beside him was a\nbig slab of meat, and the delicious scent of it assaulted his nostrils and\nsparked his instincts.\n\nHe immediately lunged and sank his teeth into the meat, growling viciously as he\ntore into it and nearly swallowed it whole. His eyes darted around searching for\nmore, and the human held out another thick piece. Blade ripped it from his hands\nand devoured that piece too. He lay back and sighed.\n\nHis head throbbed painfully and his body ached worse, but he was still alive.\nBlade wondered how many times he had nearly died by now and found it mildly\namusing, but at the same time he wished that he would just die anyway. Life\nwasn't worth living anymore, and every day he had spent without Akir was just\ntorture.\n\n\nAnd now that he didn't starve to death, he'd have to suffer even more.\n\n\"Hello,\" the human said, \"my name is Riley.\" He was young and had a head full of\nblack hair, and he wore animal skin for clothing instead of linens.\n\nBlade opened and eye and stared at him. His first instinct was to thank him, but\nhe wasn't in the mood. He hated humans anyway, and he was surprised that one of\nthem would even consider helping a dragon.\n\n\"Can you talk?\"\n\nBlade just blinked at him. What dragon couldn't talk?\n\n\"Well, okay... uhm... Just stay here and get some rest, I guess. I'll bring you\nmore food.\"\n\nBlade watched him leave and then stood up. He still could hardly walk, but at\nleast he could move. He opened the door and poked his head out. It looked like\nhe was in a human village; there weren't any other ferals or even two-legs\naround, and everything looked pretty small.\n\nHe stumbled out and then hobbled away toward a line of trees. No one seemed to\nnotice him, and Blade was soon stepping through the forest to make his escape.\n\nHe didn't want a human's help, and he was rather annoyed that one of them had\nsaved his life. Even so, Blade had to admit that he was feeling much better.\nHaving food in his stomach was a welcoming feeling, and his muscles thanked him\nfor it. He hunted for more and pinned down another meal: a small feline that got\ntoo curious and close to a big, hungry dragon.\n\nBlade had forgotten how hard it was to hunt for food. He continued looking\naround, but he scared almost every valuable target away. It wasn't long before\nhe realized that it was probably because of his powerful, grotesque scent that\nsmelled of death. He hadn't bathed since that day... What had it been, a month\nago now?\n\nInstead of looking for food, Blade listened for the sound of running water and\neventually came upon a river deep in the wilderness. He shoved his face in the\ncold, refreshing water and drank nearly a full gallon before taking a breath.\n\nHe winced as he stepped into the rushing river, his feathers flaring out as the\ncold water seeped into his bones. He shivered and growled, baring his fangs. The\nmore his body was submerged, the more wounds the frigid water covered. It took\nhim a while to grow accustomed to such cold water, but thankfully he was able to\nstand at the bottom of the river and keep just his head above the water.\n\nOne good bath later and Blade felt rejuvenated. His mood wasn't any better, but\nhis body thanked him greatly. Blood still stained his feathers in some places,\nbut he hoped that would wear off before long. He never liked being dirty, let\nalone looking completely ragged like a wild animal. The drenched bandages didn't\nhelp either, but at least his wounds would probably heal faster with them.\n\nBut now, that was all Blade was—a wild animal. He wandered west around the\nforest for months, finding more and more human camps similar to the first one he\ncame across. Of course, he had no interest in them and found it very annoying to\nconstantly have to avoid the humans. Some of them were even brave enough to\nattack Blade and hunt him as some sort of trophy, but he made quick work of\nthem.\n\nHis wounds healed very slowly, but after a few months they had healed to the\npoint that he no longer ached. The only thing that hurt was his heart.\n\nBlade never forgot Akir, Asha, or Talia—even Vespera would have been welcomed\ncompany. He longed for any sort of contact, to be back in the city again. He\nfelt so very alone, and being in this giant forest made him feel completely\nisolated from the world, trapped in his own thoughts.\n\nThe first time Blade met someone else, he happened upon a real, wild dragon. And\nthat's all he was, a wild dragon. He spoke in a tongue Blade had never heard\nbefore and seemed very aggressive, so Blade kept his distance and left, despite\nlonging to stay with him for company.\n\nThe next time, Blade found a small city. He had wandered far enough through the\nforest that he came up to the other end of the continent, finding himself on the\nwestern coast. This city was very small in comparison, but Blade hoped that\nmaybe this was where he could start a new life... a life without Akir.\n\nBlade flew down and landed in an empty area between some buildings. He was\nimmediately surprised not to feel his paws sifting through the sand as he\nwalked, but instead stepping on solid ground. This dirt road led to a bustling\ncobblestone road. His paws had already been sore from walking too much, and this\nrough, hard road certainly didn't help.\n\nUnlike his old city, this one appeared to have almost as many ferals as there\nwere two-legs. Blade ambled down the busy street, noticing a lot of feral\ndragons and gryphons mostly, but there were some wolves and felines too. For\nbeing an outsider, he felt at bit more at ease to be with his own kind.\n\nThe majority of the buildings here were made out of wood instead of stone and\nsandstone, and the architecture was different too. Instead of rounded corners\nand roofs, everything was blocky and cube-like. It even looked like there were\nhouses stacked on other houses, much like the area Vespera lived in.\n\nBlade stopped in the center of a market, resting next to a fountain while crowds\nof people walked around him. It was loud and busy, just like home.\n\nBlade dipped his head into the fountain and took a drink, but before he could\nfinish a squawk sounded next to him.\n\n\"Gross! You drink that water? That's so gross, oh my goodness,\" an\norange-feathered gryphon said.\n\nBlade finished his drink and wiped his lips, staring sternly at him. The gryphon\nhad dark-orange feathers on his front half and bright-orange feathers on his\nlower half, but his underbelly was completely dark-gray. The same charcoal color\nmarked his face and body in blotchy designs as well as his feline paws like\nsocks. He stood about as tall as Blade's shoulders, like most gryphons.\n\n\"What is gross?\" Blade asked gruffly. He was almost startled by his own voice.\nIt was deeper than normal, a tad bit raspy, and it sounded like he hadn't spoken\nin half a year... which was exactly true.\n\n\"That!\" he squeaked, pointing at the fountain. \"That water's not for drinking!\nI've had lots of baths in there, and I'm not the only one... bleegh...\" He made\na weird face and grimaced. \"I can't believe you actually drank that, you weirdo.\nYou're not from around here, are you?\"\n\nBlade wore a frown and didn't really say much. This gryphon reminded him a lot\nabout Vespera's talkative quirks, and those got on Blade's nerves quick.\n\n\"No...\"\n\nThe sunset-colored gryphon sat next to Blade on his haunches and cocked his head\nsideways. \"Where're you from then? And why are you so dirty? Why don't you take\na bath while we talk!\" he offered and hopped into the fountain himself,\nsplashing Blade with water.\n\nBlade grumbled quietly and thought about leaving... but this was the first\nconversation he had since he left. He reluctantly climbed into the fountain with\nthe gryphon and tried to clean himself. It was rather hard to do when there were\nso many eyes staring in their direction.\n\n\"I'm from the east,\" Blade answered and ruffled his feathers.\n\n\"Really?\" he asked. \"There's nothing but human villages and wild ferals in the\nforest... You're not a wild dragon, are you?\" His purple eyes widened at the\npossibility.\n\nBlade shook his head. \"No...\"\n\n\"Well, you certainly can't be from the desert! There's nothing there. Just a\nbunch of sand. I bet you're from the north! I don't know very many northern\ndragons because I grew up in the south, but your feathers still throw me for a\nloop. I've never seen a dragon with feathers before!\" he exclaimed almost too\nexcitedly.\n\nBlade sighed. Even on the other side of the continent his species was very rare.\nHe wondered if he'd ever meet another feathered dragon face-to-face.\n\n\"No, I'm from the east... from across the desert. I lived on the other coast.\"\nBlade winced as he rubbed a big scar across his belly.\n\n\"OH WOW, REALLY!?\" he squawked. \"That's so cool! I didn't know that there were\npeople living all the way over there. Oooooh, what was it like? Are there other\nfeather-dragons over there? Was there just sand all over the place?\"\n\nThe gryphon's pure, genuine surprise almost startled Blade. He pinned his ears\nback and shrugged his wings. \"I... uhm. I haven't met really any of my kind...\nBut there was definitely a lot of sand.\"\n\nThe gryphon was literally wiggling with excitement. \"Cool, cool, cool! What\nabout gryphons? Are there gryphons there too?\"\n\nBlade nodded. \"There are, yes.\"\n\n\"That sounds like an amazing place! I bet the sun was really warm... Oooh, I'd\nlove to just lie on a rock all day and take it all in!\" The pleasant look on his\nface was more than enough to tell Blade how delighted he would have been.\n\n\"Why did you leave?\" the gryphon asked, perking his ears a little. He couldn't\nbelieve that Blade would leave such a paradise.\n\nBlade grumbled and turned his head away. \"I-I don't really want to talk about\nthat...\"He went to clean his shoulder and then hissed painfully. Despite having\nhealed completely, it still from extremely tender and sore from where he was\nshot.\n\nHe noticed Blade's pain and curiously clacked his beak as he inspected it. Most\nof Blade's feathers had grown back, but they still couldn't hide the giant scar\nthere.\n\n\"Ouch! That must have hurt a lot... Wow, what is that from?\"\n\nBlade sighed and tried to pet his feathers down now that he had cleaned most of\nthe grime from them. \"A gun.\"\n\n\"What's a gun?\"\n\n\"It's uhm... a thing that goes boom and shoots rocks,\" Blade explained and\nclimbed out of the fountain. Water dripped from his soaked feathers and dribbled\nonto the stone plaza.\n\n\"Oh! You mean a cannon? WOW, how did you survive a CANNON!?\" He hopped out too\nand then shook his body like a dog, spraying water droplets everywhere, even on\nthose who were just walking by. They shot the both of them strange looks, but\notherwise continued on with their lives.\n\nBlade winced, finding the gryphon to be too loud. He didn't like other people\nhearing their conversation—especially if it meant him talking about what\nhappened that night.\n\n\"N-no... it was like a smaller cannon. Hand-sized.\" Blade looked around,\nwondering if there was any way he could get away from this gryphon before he was\nsucked into something he didn't want to talk about.\n\n\"Oh, I see! You look like you've been in a war or something... Is that what\nhappened? Is that why you're here now?\" he asked. His eyes were wide with a\nmixture of curiosity and awe.\n\nBlade didn't think twice. \"Yes. I... uhm... fled.\"\n\n\"I see, I see... That makes so much sense! You came quite a long ways, though.\nThink you'll settle in here? It's a really nice city! I've lived here for about\neight years now, and it's been really fun. Everyone here is so nice!\"\n\nBlade shuffled on his paws. \"I'm not really sure...\"\n\n\"Well, let me show you around first!\" he squawked happily, already leading Blade\naway from the fountain. \"My name is Renjee, by the way. What's yours,\nfeatherbutt?\"\n\nBlade hesitated, but ultimately he thought it would be a good idea to scope out\nthe city. Maybe he could actually settle down here...\n\n\"Blade,\" he answered and followed Renjee down a stone path that cut away from\nthe market.\n\n\"Nice to meet you, Blade! That's a really cool name. You must have had awesome\nparents!\"\n\nBlade clenched his teeth and felt a nagging pain in his chest. Akir had been his\nparent... Talia, too, in his recent years. \"Y-yeah... I did.\"\n\n\"My parents were pretty nice too, but they were B-O-R-I-N-G! Still, I should go\nvisit them some time. They're probably worried sick about me!\"\n\nBlade wondered what it would be like to have actual parents, to have a home to\ngo back to and someone worrying about him... He sighed and hoped that Talia and\nAsha were doing well. He missed them greatly. He wondered if Asha would miss her\nparents like he did when he was younger.\n\nBlade sighed.\n\nRenjee led on, talking and blabbing about every little thing he could find. The\nweird thing was—despite Blade's initial annoyance with the gryphon—was that he\nfelt... comforted. To finally have someone to talk to was more than enough, but\nconstantly listening to Renjee distracted him from his thoughts. Blade hardly\nhad time to think!\n\nThe city had a lot of unique qualities to it, though not as many as Renjee\nthought there were. It was constructed on top of a large hill, so a lot of the\nbuildings were built into the hillside. There was an underground tunnel Renjee\nshowed him that cut through the earth and opened up in three other entrances. It\nwas a quicker means of travel for those who couldn't fly.\n\nThey visited the sea, and it was colder here than on the other side of the\ncontinent. The smell of sea salt and brine was stronger too. More ships filled\nthe harbor, and Blade could watch them leaving and arriving in the distance,\nreminding him of his and Akir's little game.\n\nDifferent from Blade's city, there didn't seem to be a separation of the classes\nhere. Everyone was equal as far as he could tell. When they walked through a\nricher housing district, Blade saw an almost even mixture of ferals and two-legs\nthere. There weren't any specific races assigned to guard duty, either. In fact,\nthere weren't very many human guards at all, let alone humans in general. Blade\nliked that a lot.\n\nAnd when the sun began to set, Renjee led Blade to his house in a poorer\ndistrict. To Blade, the citizens here were by no means poor. He knew what\npoverty truly was, and the people here were only mildly inconvenienced—though he\nnever told Renjee that.\n\n\"This is it!\" Renjee said happily and opened his door for Blade. It was a wooden\nsliding door. \"Home sweet home.\"\n\nBlade stepped inside and immediately smelled the gryphon's strong scent all\nover. The interior was a little cramped by the walls, but it was still larger\nthan Blade's old home. Alike Blade's home, there wasn't much furniture; there\nwere some beds lying around and then the usual containers for water and food.\n\n\"It's not much, but it's enough for me!\" Renjee said happily and trotted into\nthe next room just to flop on a bed. He wriggled around on his back and warbled\nwith delight.\n\nBlade bared a small smile and looked around. \"It is a nice home,\" Blade\ncomplimented. \"Do you live alone?\"\n\nRenjee nodded. \"Thanks! You're welcome to stay here as long as you like. I\nhaven't actually had anyone live with me before. There's more than enough room,\nand I could use someone to talk to!\"\n\nBlade wondered how many more topics Renjee could even find to discuss. He was\nlike an endless, jubilant orator. Blade wasn't sure how Renjee managed to\nconvince him to stay the night, but it was probably the enticing warmth of\nhaving a bed to sleep on.\n\nAfter finally telling Renjee that he needed his sleep, Blade slinked away into\nhis own room and curled up on one of Renjee's many beds. He groaned softly and\nfluffed up his feathers, his sore body almost shuddering delightedly. It was\nsuch an amazing feeling to finally feel comfortable. Blade fell asleep almost\ninstantly.\n\nBlade spent the next month with Renjee. The gryphon grew on him, and Blade\nreally liked spending time with him. It was a good distraction away from his\ntorturing thoughts. Little by little his memories stopped haunting him, and he\nstarted to forget the pain. He still missed Akir dearly and wished he could see\nAsha and Talia again, but it was comforting to know that they were better off\nwithout him.\n\nRenjee brought Blade to a few of his friends, and they all had fairly uppity\nattitudes too; Blade was surprised that most of Renjee's friends were dragons\nand not more gryphons. He liked a couple of them, but having more than one\nRenjee was a headache. Everyone seemed a lot happier here, and that raised\nBlade's spirits a little each day.\n\nThe more time Blade spent with Renjee, the more he really started to like him.\nRenjee was very kind and caring; he was very interested in what other's had to\nsay too, not just himself. Blade opened up a little bit more at a time, but he\nstill kept why he left his old life behind a secret.\n\nThe next month, Blade was smiling more and more and getting much friendlier with\nRenjee. They'd go out together each day, find their food, play around and talk,\nand then go back home to rest.\n\nRenjee didn't have much of a job, so Blade was going to teach him a few tricks\nabout stealing, but the gryphon shook his head profusely and stated that he\nwould never steal. And honestly, Blade didn't really want to steal either, but\nhe never thought about not stealing. They would occasionally find an odd job and\ndo it to earn some extra coin. That felt extremely odd to Blade, but very\nrewarding.\n\nFor once in the last year, life was treating Blade much better. There were a few\ndays that he'd get all mopey, but Renjee was there to help him. But the worst\nday had yet to come.\n\nBlade realized that it was nearly a year later since that night. He had been\naway from home for so long that he thought he was feeling homesick, but Blade\nfelt worse than that. His stomach twisted and turned all day, despite Renjee\ntrying to comfort him. The pain was creeping back into his bones, and his\nthoughts were in dark places.\n\nBlade pulled Renjee against him, hugging and wrapping his paws around the\nsmaller gryphon while they cuddled in the same bed. Recently, this was how they\nslept together, sharing their warmth as the cold winter came upon them. Blade\nhad no idea that other places of the world went through seasons and found it\nrather fascinating, but at the same time he missed the warmth of the sun against\nhis feathers.\n\nRenjee was so soft and huggable that Blade couldn't resist squeezing on him and\nnuzzling into his warm feathers. He realized Akir must have felt the same with\nBlade...\n\nBlade sighed. Renjee twined their tails together and looked up at Blade with a\nquiet warble.\n\n\"What's wrong, Blade? You've been acting like a grump-butt today,\" Renjee said.\n\n\"I don't know... I'm just not feeling well.\"\n\n\"Why? Are you sick? This time of the year, a lot of people get sick... But...\nWhat's on your mind?\"\n\nBlade winced and shrugged his shoulders. He had told Renjee a lot of what\nactually happened that night, but he had never told him the whole truth; he\nwasn't sure if he could handle telling him without breaking down completely.\n\n\"Is it about those people you killed?\"\n\nBlade frowned and shook his head. \"I probably just need some rest.\" Now he\nsounded like Akir.\n\nRenjee turned around in Blade's embrace so they lay together, belly to belly. He\nlooked into Blade's golden eyes with wide, sincere, purple spheres and gently\npet the soft feathers puffing out at his chest. A warm smile cracked his beak.\n\n\"Well, maybe I have an idea that will help you feel better! B-but uhm—are you\nuhm—Do you like other males?\" Renjee looked up at Blade bashfully with his\nfeathers all puffed out around his head. \"I've been wanting to ask you that.\"\n\nBlade blushed a little. Renjee didn't know about his relationship with Akir.\nBlade had thought about mating with Renjee plenty, but he had never been sure\nwith himself. He wasn't ready to move on... No... He wasn't sure if he would\never be ready. But the warm thought of sharing intimate relations with someone\nelse again... Gods, he needed that pleasure, and it would really help him feel\nbetter right now.\n\nBlade took the initiative and dipped his forepaw between the gryphon's legs,\nfinding his plump orbs and thick sheath. He took them in his paw and rubbed\naround in circles as a small smile spread his lips.\n\nRenjee squawked as his feathers flared out. His eyes shut and his tongue lolled\nout. \"Oooh gods, Blaaaade!\" The gryphon spread his legs open and buried his beak\ninto Blade's chest, warbling and cooing with delight.\n\nBlade gulped and felt uncertain, but he kept going. He could feel Renjee's\nsheath already stirring, thickening up and swelling just before his pink,\ntapered tip poked out of it. Blade grabbed his orbs and gently squeezed them and\nrolled them around in his paw while he looked down and watched the gryphon's\ncock grow.\n\nGetting Renjee worked up made Blade get all worked up. He hadn't felt any sexual\nstimulation in so long... His length grew quickly and his mind fogged over with\nlust.\n\nIt happened so fast that all of these memories started to play through Blade's\nmind—memories about mating with Akir that Blade had locked away until now. All\nof those wonderful times they spent together...\n\nRenjee stood up and raised his rump and tail high into the air, waiting for\nBlade to mount him. Blade stared blankly ahead, hesitating with each and every\nstep while his heart throbbed almost painfully in his chest.\n\nHis body craved this; it wanted to satisfy all of his pent-up desires. Staring\nbeneath the gryphon's tail roused so many lustful feelings inside him, but Blade\ncouldn't think straight. It wasn't Renjee that he was seeing, no—it was Akir.\n\nHe remembered his and Akir's first time together. He remembered how much they\nhad loved each other, and how much of that love had gone into their mating. He\nremembered what Akir felt like and how he looked when he was pleasured. And\nBlade remembered what it felt like to have Akir pleasure him...\n\nBlade felt tears suddenly spill from his eyes and run down his cheeks. He'd\nnever be able to feel that pleasure again... No, he couldn't. As much as he\nliked Renjee, Blade couldn't say that he loved him. It was too soon for that...\nAnd he couldn't betray Akir so soon. They had spent so, so many years together.\nWhat they had was more than love; it was a deep-rooted bond they built from\nspending their entire lives together. Blade had only known Renjee for maybe half\nof a year\n\nWhat was I thinking? Blade sniffled and whimpered, shutting his eyes as memories\nof Akir flooded him. His breathing grew ragged as he started to sob\nuncontrollably. He leaned to the side and nearly fell over.\n\n\"B-Blade? Blade, what's wrong? D-did I do something wrong? Did you not want\nthis?\" Renjee licked and nuzzled Blade affectionately, trying his best to\ncomfort the dragon. But Blade was lost in his own mind; he hardly noticed Renjee\nthere.\n\nHe tried to wipe his eyes, but his tears kept pouring out. All of the sadness he\nhad locked away broke free, filling him with sorrow. He was so close to being\nhappy again... so close to being like himself—but Blade realized he would never\nbe the same again.\n\nWhen Akir had died, he had died too.\n\n\"I'm... I'm so s-sorry, Renjee,\" Blade sobbed.\n\n\"It's okay, Blade! C'mon, let's just lie down. We don't have to mate. I just\nthought you might like it.\"\n\nBlade shook his head and clenched his teeth. \"I-I can't... I have to go... I...\nI need to go home.\"\n\nRenjee warbled sadly and looked at Blade with a hurt expression. \"What do you\nmean? I... I thought you liked it here... Blade?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Renjee,\" Blade said and felt like a sword had lodged itself in his\nchest. He hurt again. That same, agonizing pain returned. Blade coughed and\nclutched his chest before whirling around and running out of the house. Renjee\ncalled after him, but Blade was out of the door and in the sky in seconds.\n\nSeeing Renjee hurt like that... Blade couldn't bear the sight. He never wanted\nthat to happen. Renjee would be better off without Blade too.\n\nThe world was better off without Blade.\n\nBlade flew directly east for as long as he could until his wings were nearly\nready to fall off. Again, he was leaving behind everything, but this time he\nwasn't going to start over elsewhere. It was going to end where it began.\n\nIt took Blade nearly a full month of straight flying to finally see the desert\nagain. Sand dunes rolled over the landscape for nearly as far as he could see.\nBefore he continued, he stopped to rest and take a big drink of water as well as\nfind his last meal before making his trek over the desert.\n\nBlade was much more prepared this time, and he wasn't half-dead either, so he\nflew through the cool breeze of the night and made a considerable distance. By\nthe next day, the city was in sight.\n\nBlade didn't think about how badly his wings hurt. There were too many thoughts\nrunning through his mind, too many memories that he was drowning in. Everything\nlooked exactly the same, the sun felt the same, and the air was the same. Life\ncontinued on without him.\n\nBlade dipped down from the sky and flew to the market district, toward an herb\nshop that Talia had told him to get supplies from before. He landed in the\nmarket area, finding a familiar sense of belonging as he was surrounded by\npeople that he used to recognize. He worried for a moment that someone would\nrecognize him, as he was sure that if he was caught he would be attacked and\nkilled on sight. But Blade realized that he didn't care.\n\nHe walked into the herb shop and approached the old fox lady with a glaring\nexpression. \"I need a vial of dragonsroot oil.\"\n\nShe regarded him with a curt response and retrieved what he asked for. \"This\nisn't easy to come by. Two gold coins.\"\n\nBlade growled and bared his fangs, reaching out his paw. \"Give it to me.\"\n\nShe gave it to him, but she didn't show a single shred of fear in her eyes.\n\"What are you going to use it for?\"\n\nBlade took it and shivered, ignoring her question. \"Thank you,\" he said and\nwalked out. He took off into the air, clutching the vial in his paw. He looked\nat it momentarily and felt his gut twist uncomfortably as he stared at the\nstrange, light-brown liquid. Just one drop of this would burn his flesh\nintensely... He wondered how much pain he would experience swallowing it all.\n\nWith the tilt of his wings, Blade glided down to his old home. He had told\nhimself he'd never come back here, but he wanted to see it all one last time\nbefore he went to see Akir.\n\nWhen Blade stepped inside, his heart beat against his chest like a hammer. He\ncould hardly breathe, and his eyes were tearing up. It was still abandoned, and\nit looked like it had never changed. Blood stains still splattered the floor and\nwooden pieces were scattered all over.\n\nBlade looked around, crying and just letting his emotions seep out of him. He\nwalked into their bedroom and remembered when they first put that bed in. Their\nfirst night together on it... Blade whimpered and buried his nose into the fur\nsheets, trying to smell Akir's scent again. And for a brief, blissful second, he\nthought he did, but it was his imagination.\n\nEverything smelled old and dusty, and their home looked like it was ravaged.\nNothing was what it used to be.\n\nBlade's satchel was still left where he threw it, and he checked to see if there\nwere still any coins left in it. There weren't any left in the exterior pouch,\nbut he was unpleasantly surprised to see the decayed remains of the fruit he had\nbought a year ago. The golden band that he had bought for Akir was still there,\nleft in an interior pouch. Scavengers must not have checked through the\nfoul-smelling, rotting fruit.\n\nBlade grabbed it and held it in his paw, smiling softly as he imagined Akir\nwearing the earring. He set it down on the floor in front of him and looked at\nthe vial, feeling his heart racing in his chest. Blade frowned and sniffed,\nuncertain. Was this really the end?\n\nAfter all of his pain and anguish, would killing himself really free him? What\nif the afterlife was real? Would he see Akir there? Was Akir waiting for him?\nBlade sniffled and started to sob harder.\n\nHe missed Akir so much... He couldn't bear life without his mate. He tried to go\nalone and he failed. He came crawling back right to where it all ended, where\nhis and Akir's life had ended. He wished he could go back to how things were\nbefore, but everything would soon come to an end.\n\nBlade thought about Asha and felt like he was stabbed in the gut. He was a\nfailure, no matter how he looked at it. His mate died because he couldn't\nprotect him and he abandoned his daughter because he couldn't control himself.\nAnd Talia... He would be a disappointment to her. She saved him on more than one\noccasion, and now he was just going to throw his life away.\n\nAre you waiting for me, Akir? Blade uncorked the cap to the vial and felt\nhimself shaking. His wings trembled at his sides and his tail swished back and\nforth. He thought about Renjee and how he had just left his new friend and\nabandoned him too. If Renjee found out Blade was dead... That didn't matter.\nBlade would be dead, and he wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore. He\ncould be with his mate.\n\n\"I'm coming, Akir,\" Blade said softly. He tried to think about the good times he\nhad with his mate, and a small smile curled his lips while tears continued to\nfall. He remembered when they had first met, how Akir saved his life...\n\nSudden warmth filled him, residing mostly in his chest while it flowed like\nwater through the rest of his body. It was so calming and nurturing that it felt\nlike Akir was wrapping him in the warmest of embraces, whispering softly into\nhis ear and telling him everything was going to be okay.\n\nBlade winced and sighed. He remembered how Akir took such loving care of him. He\nnurtured and raised Blade, taught him valuable lessons, and made him who he was\ntoday. Akir devoted his entire life to loving Blade. From the first day he met\nBlade to his very last, Akir was there for Blade, protecting him. And even now,\nit felt like Akir was still here with him.\n\nAkir didn't want Blade to die. Blade didn't want to die.\n\nBlade cried out and dropped the vial away from him, the glass shattering and\nspilling the lethal liquid over the ground. He clutched his stomach and felt\nonto his side, crying profusely. Akir didn't want him to die.\n\nBeautiful memories washed over Blade as he sobbed uncontrollably. He remembered\nwhen Akir first said 'I love you' to him as a mate. Old, familiar feelings\nwelled inside Blade, taking away the pain and agony he had felt for the last\nyear. He was filled instead with joy. To know that Akir loved him warmed Blade's\nheart, and if Akir was truly waiting for him, he would want Blade to live a full\nlife before coming to see him again.\n\nAkir would want Blade to be happy.\n\nI will wait for you, Blade, and I will be with you every step of the way—until\nwe see each other again.\n\nBlade lay there for hours, crying and reminiscing about all of his happiest\nmemories. Most of his pain finally disappeared, leaving him relieved. He stood\nup on trembling legs and looked around one last time. He thought about visiting\nTalia before he left again and figured that it wouldn't hurt to see his old\nfriend. He thought about visiting Vespera and Asha too... but he knew he\nshouldn't.\n\nBlade found Asha's toy dragon next to her broken crib and felt a twinge of pain.\nHe wanted so badly to see how Asha had grown and to be a part of her life again,\nbut Blade was still a danger to her here. If he could just take her with him...\nBlade sighed and clenched his teeth. He couldn't do that to Vespera, to take\naway her daughter again after they had already bonded. Vespera had a life here,\nso she couldn't just leave it behind either.\n\nBlade sighed and started to walk out after grabbing the earring and Asha's toy,\nbut then something caught his eye. It was a few pieces of paper sticking out of\ntheir old furs. He hadn't noticed those before, and he quickly went to grab\nthem. He stared at the scribbled runes and sifted through them, but Blade didn't\nknow how to read. It looked like a letter of sorts, and there was a heart at the\nend of it.\n\nAkir... Blade folded the paper neatly and tucked it close to him as he quickly\npadded out of the house and took off toward Talia. His wings felt so very sore,\nbut he winced through the pain and flew as fast as he could. He landed directly\noutside of Talia's home and pounded on her door.\n\nTalia opened it and looked very surprised to see Blade. Blade smiled warmly at\nher and immediately hugged around her with his wings.\n\n\"Blade...\" She squeezed him back and invited him inside, quickly shutting the\ndoor behind him. \"I've been so worried about you.\"\n\nBlade nodded and sheepishly pawed at the ground. \"It's been... rough,\" he\nstated, not wanting to tell Talia any details. \"But I feel... much better. A lot\nbetter.\"\n\n\"I'm glad, Blade. I've missed seeing you around all the time. What has it been,\na year now?\"\n\nBlade nodded and chuckled lightly. Talia grinned widely at him and sat down in\nher chair while he lay down next to her, handing her the papers. He held Asha's\ntoy in front of him and set the earring down, smiling softly.\n\n\"What's this?\" she asked, looking through them.\n\nBlade shrugged his wings. \"I was hoping you could read them to me. I... I think\nAkir wrote them, but I can't read.\"\n\n\"He never taught you to read?\" Talia asked with disbelief. \"That foolish sack of\nsca—... S-sorry.\"\n\nBlade grinned, finishing Talia's sentence in his mind. \"It's fine. What does it\nsay?\"\n\nHe saw Talia briefly skim over it and saw how her eyes softened. \"Oh, Blade...\nThis... This is going to be hard for me to read.\"\n\n\"Is it from Akir?\" he asked. His heart thrummed excitedly while his tail swished\nbehind him. He wanted to know what Akir wrote. He wondered why Akir hadn't shown\nhim the letters before, but it must have been something he had been waiting for.\n\nShe nodded. \"To Blade, the love of my life: I'm so sorry. I wanted nothing more\nthan to be the greatest mate to you, but I failed to keep that promise with you.\nI made one too many mistakes, and this time it has cost me my life. Today, I am\ngoing to die.\n\n\"I wait here, writing this while you and Asha sleep, worrying and trying to hold\nback my fears. I know you'll wake soon, and I hope I can finish writing this\nbefore you do. You've been so worried about me lately, and it warms my heart to\nknow that you care, and I wish I could have told you—I wish I could have been a\nbetter mate.\n\nI wish I could have told you that today was my last day. Gods, I wish I could\nhave held you in my arms one last time and cried into your shoulder. I wish I\ncould have honestly told you everything would be alright. There's so much I wish\nI could have done, Blade, but this is the end for me.\"\n\nTears poured from Blade. He clenched his paws tightly and buried his face under\na wing, sniffling and sobbing quietly. He could hear Talia's voice cracking and\nbreaking too while she read, and she sniffled almost as often as he did. But she\nheld strong and continued:\n\n\"I'm going to send you and Asha away so you're safe. I wish I could have\nprepared you better for this. I know it's going to be hard, and I wish there was\nanother way. But I know that if I had said anything, you would be here with me,\nand we would both die. I can't bear the thought of you or Asha dying, Blade, and\nI'm so sorry that I will no longer be here for you. This is the only way.\n\n\"There was a part of my life I kept secret from you, and I'll still spare most\nof the details to keep you from doing anything reckless. I was and always have\nbeen a thief; you should know that. But I led a guild of thieves, and I've\nstolen so much more than you could imagine. I wanted to build a better future\nfor our family, and I had been so close to achieving that dream. There has been\na certain group that's wanted me dead for a while, and they didn't find me until\nrecently. And today is the day they come for me.\n\n\"I can do no more for our family, but I have amassed a small fortune to leave\nbehind for you and Asha. It's enough for you both to live comfortably for the\nrest of your lives. Do you remember the first home we ever had—the cave on the\ncoast? It's buried underneath that wooden toy you had given me when we were\nyounger—yes, I had kept it!\n\n\"I love you, Blade, truly and sincerely; I couldn't have asked for a better\nmate. You've made my days warm and happy, and there's nothing more I could have\nasked from you. You are perfect, and I hope that maybe one day we'll see each\nother again. With all of my heart Blade, I love you. Take care of yourself and\nAsha. I will be waiting.\"\n\nBlade had nearly balled his eyes out by the time Talia had finished. There were\nso many memories brought back to life by that letter, and he could practically\nhear it all in Akir's voice.\n\nAkir had known that he would die. He sacrificed himself so Blade and Asha would\nhave better lives without him, and Blade nearly threw that all away.\n\n\"Why... Why didn't he try to run? We could have left... We could have been safe\nsomewhere else...\" Blade said, musing over other outcomes.\n\nTalia sniffled and sighed, setting the letter down beside her. \"Akir was smart,\nBlade. I'm sure he thought about that. He wanted you and Asha to be safe, and\nwhoever was after him would have probably hunted him down. It's how you feel\nabout Asha, you know.\"\n\nBlade nodded in understanding and clenched his talons together tightly. \"I wish\nhe would have told me... but he was right. I would have tried to protect him,\nand I would have died with him...\" Blade sighed and teared up again. \"I loved\nhim so much.\"\n\n\"I know, Blade,\" Talia said and stroked the back of his neck gently. \"But you're\nalive now, and that's all that matters.\" Her finger traced over one of his\nscars. \"You've gone through a lot... Why don't you find somewhere to settle down\nthat's far, far away?\"\n\nBlade nodded and stood up, grabbing Asha's toy and the ring. \"I have somewhere\nalready, and someone I should be with. I should have just stayed there, but I'm\nglad I didn't. Thank you for reading those to me, Talia. It... It means a lot.\"\n\n\"Of course, Blade,\" Talia said softly and handed the papers to him. \"Take these,\nBlade. Even if you can't read, you'll want them.\" She stood up and hugged around\nhim again. \"Try to learn to read, alright? It's pretty important.\"\n\nBlade chuckled and nodded, nuzzling her affectionately. \"Thanks for being here\nfor me. I hope I'll see you again.\"\n\n\"I'm getting old, Blade. Just... don't be surprised if I'm not here the next\ntime you come.\" Talia looked at him kindly and stroked between his horns.\n\nBlade's expression softened as he nodded. \"I understand. Take care, Talia. I'll\nmiss you.\"\n\nTalia smiled and opened the door for Blade. \"I'll miss you too. Goodbye, Blade.\"\n\nThe door shut behind him, leaving Blade in a slight daze. So much had happened\nand he hardly any time to sift through it. He shook his body and fluffed up his\nfeathers, trying to feel just a little bit more normal again. He took off and\nflew towards the coast, quickly coming upon that cave he and Akir lived at long\nago.\n\nIt was cold and dank inside, and a lot smaller than what he remembered. He found\nthe wooden toy gryphon Blade had given Akir. He had found it outside the city\none day, completely abandoned. Blade smiled and moved it to the side as he dug\ninto the ground. His claws soon scraped a wooden trunk, so Blade dug around it\nand was eventually able to lift it up; it was very heavy.\n\nBlade grunted and set it down, opening it to find more shiny things than he\ncould have ever imagined. Jewels and gold brimmed the very top of it, and then\nBlade realized that there was another similar trunk beneath that. His golden\neyes widened as he pawed through some of it, utterly amazed. There was no way he\ncould carry all of this!\n\nThankfully, Akir had smartly set aside four different satchels. Blade stuffed\ntwo of them with as much as he could carry and flew back toward the city. His\nwings hurt badly, but he couldn't help but to smile. He stopped at Talia's house\nagain and set one of the satchels down. He knocked loudly on her door and\nquickly took off.\n\nHe leapt into the sky and flew toward the feral district. He landed for a moment\nat Vespera's door and set down the other satchel with Asha's old toy inside,\nhoping that it would find its way to his daughter. He deeply wished that he\ncould tell her how much he loved her and hoped that she would grow up the way he\nhad imagined. He wished he could give her one big hug and tell her that he was\nsorry... But it was best for her to never see him again. At least now he knew\nshe would have a better life—and Vespera too.\n\nBlade sniffled and took off again after knocking on the door, this time back\ntoward the coast. He clutched Akir's earring in his paw and thought about\nRenjee. He hoped he could return to the gryphon and apologize profusely for\nleaving him like that. He hoped that Renjee didn't move on already too. Blade\nwould have been missing for almost two months by the time he returned.\n\nHe stopped back at the cave and filled only one satchel halfway this time and\nstuffed Akir's letter and ring inside. He buried the two trunks again, having\nhardly made a dent in the first one, and tried to wipe any evidence of him being\nhere away. If he ever needed money again, he could return here. Then he took off\nagain and flew west.\n\nBlade sighed, feeling his aching wings struggling to carry him as he flew past\nthe city. He wouldn't be able to fly as recklessly as before, and it would\nprobably be longer than a month until he saw Renjee again.\n\nBut then he heard a familiar squawk come from above him as a feathered mass\nnearly tumbled into Blade. Blade yelped and caught Renjee, straining his wings\neven more as he held tightly to him. Renjee was panting and trembling, his wings\ndrooping listlessly at his sides. Blade flew down to a sand dune and propped the\ngryphon up on his haunches.\n\n\"Renjee!?\" Blade hugged around him tightly with his wings, enveloping the soft\ngryphon in a warm embrace.\n\n\"O-ohmygosh... You're so... so fast... how... how did you keep flying like...\nthat... Gods, my wings hurt. Out... of breath...\"\n\nRenjee looked completely exhausted. His sunset-colored feathers were all\nruffled, his eyes could hardly stay open, and his wings didn't look like they\ncould move much more. He swayed back and forth as he sat up, unable to keep his\nbalance. \"You... followed me all the way here?\"\n\nRenjee warbled affirmatively and collapsed into Blade's arms. \"M-mostly...\nBleeergh, I think I'm going to vomit. O-oh... yup.\" Renjee broke away for a\nmoment and heaved away from Blade, making the dragon grimace and turn his nose\naway.\n\n\"You didn't have to do that...\"\n\nRenjee finished and shivered, returning back to Blade's arms. It looked like he\nhad caught his breath too, but Blade could feel his heart rapidly beating\nagainst him. \"I did! I was worried about you. You looked really sad, and I\ndidn't want to see you sad. But wow, you're a really good flier. I thought I was\ngood, but jeeze... I don't think I can fly anymore!\"\n\nBlade giggled and squeezed Renjee tightly against him. \"You'll recover. I... I\nbrought you something,\" Blade said and opened up the satchel to take the ring in\nhis paw. The golden earring rested on a paw pad. \"Do you wear earrings?\"\n\nRenjee's purple eyes brightened as he looked at it. He nodded and let Blade hook\nit through a hole that was already near the base of his left ear. \"I used to\nwear one before I met you, but I lost it. Thanks, Blade,\" he said and licked\nBlade's nose. \"Where'd you get this?\" He cocked his head at the satchel Blade\nwore.\n\n\"It was... a gift for someone very dear to me. I'll uhm... tell you about it\nlater,\" Blade said and smiled softly. Renjee did look very handsome, and that\nearring complimented his orange colors well. Blade chuckled and set the satchel\ndown in front of him. \"But this is for us!\" He opened the flap and showed Renjee\nthe pile of luxuries inside.\n\nHe doubted Renjee had ever seen so much gold before with the way his eyes\nwidened and feathers puffed out. \"Y-you didn't steal this, did you!? That's so\nmuch gold!\"\n\nBlade shook his head, but quickly realized that Akir definitely did have a part\nin stealing all of this in some way. \"No, it was a gift from that same someone\nthat was very close to me.\"\n\n\"Was he a king!? Wow! We won't ever have to work again,\" Renjee said happily.\nBlade imagined he'd be dancing around if he weren't so tired. \"But if he's so\nspecial to you... then why are you coming back with me?\" Renjee asked curiously.\n\nBlade pinned his ears back. \"He's not with us anymore...\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, Blade,\" Renjee said and nuzzled him back, trying to comfort him.\n\"He must have been really amazing.\"\n\n\"It's fine. I think I'm finally over it... I feel a lot better,\" Blade said and\nsmiled. He looked into Renjee's eyes and felt much calmer than he had before. He\ndoubted that Renjee could ever replace Akir, but it was a start.\n\n\"Why don't we take our time heading back home?\" Blade asked and playfully booped\nthe gryphon. \"You need to rest your wings anyway.\"\n\nRenjee squawked and booped back. \"Just not too long! I don't want my friends to\nworry about me missing. It's already been a month... Wow, you really do live on\nthe other coast! I saw the ocean and it looked so blue!\"\n\nBlade giggled and started to walk across the sand. Truthfully, he thought he'd\nmiss feeling it squish beneath his paws, but he looked forward to getting away\nfrom it for a while. Renjee squeaked and followed next to Blade.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\nBlade shrugged his wings and kept walking. \"We have to make time when we can,\nright? Besides, I'd like to talk to you about some stuff, and it's hard to talk\nwhen you're flying.\"\n\nRenjee nodded and looked up at Blade. \"What do you want to talk about?\"\n\nBlade looked back and smiled warmly. \"I'd like to tell you about my life, the\nimportant stuff I've left out... The good and the bad.\""
