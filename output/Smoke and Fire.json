Blade could see it from their house. The cloud was\ntwisting and turning over the eastern side of the city. He watched it curiously\nand sniffed the air. He couldn't smell anything from here, but he swore he\ncould faintly smell the smoke in the breeze.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir opened the door and came out, wondering what Blade was\ndoing. He sidled along beside him and looked where Blade was looking. They\nweren't the only two looking over in that direction. There were many ferals\nstopped in their tracks, peering over the houses and buildings. Despite the\ndesert being hotter than any place in the world, fires were extremely rare.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh wow,&#8221; Akir said. \"What do you think caught fire?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrugged his feathered wings. \"I don't know. It\ndoesn't seem all that big though. Might just be a cart or two. Want to go\nlook?&#8221; Akir nodded, so they leapt into the skies and flew to the east.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">As they climbed higher into the sky, Blade could make out\nthat the smoke was coming from the housing districts, and it looked like it was\non the edge of the eastern-most part of the districts. A sinking feeling\ngripped his stomach the closer they got.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"A- Akir? That... that isn't...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir looked very concerned too. They couldn't see much of\nanything beneath the malevolent black smoke as they flew over it, but they\nrecognized the surrounding area all too well. They had found themselves living\nin this area for some time up until just a month or so ago. And Blade knew of\nonly one wooden building around: Talia's house.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's heart pounded anxiously in his chest as he dropped\ndown and landed heavily. There was a crowd of two-legs around that peered at\nhim uneasily, but Talia wasn't in sight. Akir landed shortly after, but Blade\ndidn't want to wait around.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade!&#8221; Akir shouted as Blade tore off toward the fire.\nBlade ignored him and slipped into the obscuring smog. He had to find Talia. He\nhad to make sure she was alright.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He coughed and felt his eyes stinging as he got closer. The\nsmoldering, burning smell was too pungent for his nostrils, making them burn.\nFlames flickered within the blackness that surrounded him. They flashed and\ncaught his eye, sending a deep-rooted fear blazing in his mind. He trembled as\nthe heat caressed his feathers threateningly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Something snapped inside him, as if the fire brought a\nfamiliar sense of fear into his fleeting heart. He couldn't understand it, but\nhe felt like he had seen a fire like this before. It was as if there were\nmemories playing through his mind all over again, flickering through his vision\njust like the flame itself.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He stood outside the burning remains of Talia's home,\nhypnotized with terror. Thoughts passed his mind in the blink of an eye until\nhe finally snapped back to reality. What could have caused this?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He winced as he listened to the roaring of the fire. Wood\nsnapped and collapsed while the flames ate the house alive. He hoped and hoped\nthat Talia wasn't in there. If she was, he knew she wouldn't survive.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had no idea where the sudden courage came from, but he\nsurged forward. He couldn't lose Talia; he couldn't lose the only other person\nin the world that truly cared for him aside from Akir. If she was in there, he\nwould save her.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But just before he could get close enough to the burning\nbuilding, Akir tackled him and pinned him down. \"Blade! What the hell are you\nthinking!?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled and tried to push Akir off. The heat was\nintense, and he could almost feel it scalding his feathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I have to save her!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir growled and firmly shoved Blade down as a loud <i>crack</i> sounded behind them and hunched\nover him. Blade watched in horror as the force of whatever collapsed sent\nflames billowing out from the solid doorframe several feet away. Akir fanned\nout his wings to protect Blade. Blade suddenly felt the heat of the fire leave\nhis face as he watched Akir wince with pain and yelp.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Fear gripped Blade. He froze, his golden eyes lit with the\ndancing flames behind Akir. He could see them threateningly growing closer.\nAkir growled and dragged Blade away until they were on the other side of the\nstreet. He collapsed beside him, seeming to be trying to catch his breath, but\nthere was too much smoke filling both of their lungs.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade still couldn't move. He coughed and wheezed, feeling\nsick to his stomach. His lungs and throat hurta stinging pain filled his head.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You stupid idiots!&#8221; A familiar voice growled beside him.\nBlade broke free from his stupor and watched as Talia grabbed Akir's wings and\ntugged on them as she dragged him away. Blade meeped weakly and crawled after\nthem, but it wasn't long before Talia came back and dragged him away too.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She took them out of the smoke in front of the growing\ncrowd. Blade could almost feel their gazes focused on the two ferals and the\ntwo-leg helping them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Stupid, stupid, stupid,&#8221; Talia grumbled under her breath.\nBlade coughed some more while his head started to clear. His heart fluttered\ninside his chest rapidly, unable to stop as adrenaline coursed through him. Had\nhe almost died?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He looked at Akir and horror gripped him. Akir's scales\nalong his back were black. What were once deep-blue scales with a mixture of\ndappled purple blotches were now scorched badly. Blade whimpered and crawled\nover to him. Akir hissed and growled through clenched teeth.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What were you two thinking?&#8221; Talia growled. \"You almost got\nyourselves killed for no reason!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I... I was going to s- save you...&#8221; Blade said. He was too\nfocused on Akir to see Talia's furious glare. He wanted to hold Akir tight and never\nlet go, but after just a brief touch Akir hissed and growled with pain.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But he could hear her sigh. \"Where do you two live? We need\nto get him out of here and treat his burns.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stared at Akir with worry. He'd never seen Akir hurt\nso badly... Akir never got hurt. It was always Blade who got himself into\ntrouble, but this time Blade got Akir into trouble. He felt terrible. His\nstomach flipped around inside him and twisted itself into a knot as he\ntrembled. Now he knew how Akir had felt, but he felt worse than that. This was\nhis fault.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade and Talia helped Akir to his paws, almost carrying his\nheavy weight until they found a cart. Two-legs stared at them from all around\nwithout giving much of a thought to help. Without hesitating, Talia dumped the\ncart's contents and Blade helped her lift Akir into it. They wheeled it away\nafter hearing a disgruntled wolf growling insults&#8212;the owner of that cart. Blade\nturned and growled back at him with his fangs bared. Intimidation wasn't\nBlade's forte, but he would do anything for Akir. Nevertheless, the wolf backed\noff.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It was the longest walk of Blade's life. They took Akir all\nthe way back to their home in the feral district. He had passed out on the way,\nso they lifted him out and half-dragged him inside. Blade arranged their\nbedding in the main living area, and with Talia's help they laid him on his\nbelly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"W- What are we going to do?&#8221; Blade asked anxiously, staring\nat the burns along Akir's back. A sick, twisting feeling gripped his stomach.\nAkir was in pain.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I don't know. I need to make a salve to help his scales\nheal. He's fine for now, and he's at no risk of dying,&#8221; she assured Blade. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded, feeling slightly relieved. \"What do you need?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia sighed. \"This would be much easier had my house not\nburned down... I'll need lavender in whatever form you can get it, preferably\noil. That's the priority, but I'll also need honey, coconut oil, and the sap of\na Godswood tree. You can find all of these at an herb shop in the market\ndistrict. It's a small building next to a jewelry and linen stall.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded again and grabbed his satchel with some money.\nHe had Talia repeat the list back to him before he quickly left and took to the\nskies. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When he returned, Talia had placed wet rags along Akir's back.\nHe gave her everything she needed, including a mortar and pestle he had also\nbought. He was proud of himself for thinking ahead on that, as he knew they\ndidn't have anything like that in their home. She regarded him thoughtfully and\nstarted mixing the herbs together.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"How did this happen?&#8221; she asked as she stirred.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sat down on his haunches. \"He protected me from a\nsudden burst of flames... I... I was being stupid.&#8221; He gritted his teeth,\nremembering that this was entirely his fault. He wanted to go save someone who\ndidn't need rescuing. He let his emotions get the better of him again, and Akir\ngot hurt because of it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I must have been turned around when you two ran into the\nsmoke. I heard gasps and shouts as <i>two\nferal dragons</i> ran toward the fire. As soon as I could I ran after you two,\nbut I guess I was too late.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gulped and nodded. \"I thought you were still in\nthere...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She shook her head. \"No, I was out shopping when it happened.\nIt was quite the surprise,&#8221; she hissed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"How did it happen?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia tensed. \"I don't know... I didn't have anything that\ncould cause a fire. I expected that house to collapse on its own before it\nburned down.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So it just caught fire?&#8221; Blade asked disbelievingly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia pondered for a moment as if questioning herself whether\nor not to tell Blade something. \"I think it was deliberate.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's ears flicked nervously. \"Who would do that!?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She shrugged as if someone burning her home down didn't even\nmatter. \"I don't know. It's just a hunch.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You think someone burned your house down because they\nwanted to?&#8221; Blade couldn't imagine anyone wanting to burn her house down. Talia\nwas very nice... once you got to know her, but she was also a healer. Blade\nwasn't the only one she had fixed up in the last year: there were plenty of\nothers, mostly two-legs.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Like I said, it's just a hu&#8212;&#8221; Akir groaned and wheezed as\nhe woke up. \"Hey, hey! Don't move!&#8221; She held Akir's neck down, making him wince\nand growl.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade immediately went to see Akir's face, sitting down in\nfront of him as his torso leaned down. He nuzzled Akir's snout lovingly to\ncomfort him, looking into his eyes with concern etched into his face. Akir\nsmiled weakly back and licked Blade's nose.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"How long was I out?&#8221; Akir asked. He lay still, deciding\nthat it was his best interest to stay put for now.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"About an hour or so,&#8221; Talia answered and returned to\nstirring her remedy together.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Are you feeling okay?&#8221; Blade asked worriedly. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nodded and sighed. \"It could be worse.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm... I'm sorry, Akir...&#8221; Blade started to tear up again,\nthinking about the pain Akir was in because of him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir scowled at Blade and elicited a terse growl. \"Don't be,\nBlade.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"B- But you're hurt because of me!&#8221; he sobbed and sniffled,\nwiping his tears. \"It's my fault that you were burned...&#8221; Akir growled and hissed\nas he struggled to stand.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I said NOT to move!&#8221; Talia scolded. But Akir didn't listen\nto her. He winced and grimaced through the pain, stepping forward until he\nwrapped his torso and wings around Blade. His breath was quick and Blade could\nfeel how hot his scales were against his feathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Akir...&#8221; Blade nestled into his embrace as Akir pulled him\nclose. He licked Blade's neck affectionately and purred despite the pain\nwracking his body.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's my job to protect you, Blade. I will gladly put myself\nin harm's way if it means you will be safe.&#8221; He squeezed Blade tight and\nfinished, \"I am your mate.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade whimpered and buried his snout into his blue scales.\n\"I- I don't want you to get hurt because of me!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm...&#8221; Akir breathed heavily with pained hisses. \"I'm fine,\nBlade...&#8221; Then his weight suddenly dropped on Blade. Blade meeped and held Akir\nup as he gently laid him back down. He looked anxiously at Talia who rushed\nover with a wet rag and placed it on Akir's forehead.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She sighed and shook her head. \"Stupid idiot. He overexerted\nhimself. He's got a terrible fever, too.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade watched uneasily. He fidgeted around and clawed at the\nground while quiet whimpers escaped his lips. \"Is he going to be alright?&#8221; </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia nodded and started applying the concoction along\nAkir's back. It looked gooey and sticky, clinging to his scales. \"He just needs\nto rest right now and <i>not move.</i>&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade lay down in front of Akir, keeping a close eye on him.\nDespite Talia's constant reassurance, he felt the opposite. He wanted to hug\nand squeeze the pain right out of his mate, but he knew that would just make\nhis condition a lot worse! </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">So, he restlessly watched Akir, even after Talia had retired\nfor the night. She had nowhere else to go, so she would stay with them until\nshe found a new home. It was the least they could do!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When Akir woke again, Blade and Talia helped him to the bed.\nHe thanked them and fell fast asleep again as he sprawled out on his side. The\nsalve seemed to be helping, though it did smell rather potent.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"When do you think he'll be healed?&#8221; Blade asked as he and\nTalia returned to their living area.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It should take about a week or two for the pain to subside.\nHe'll be able to walk around more in a couple of days, though it'll be\nuncomfortable.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded, already deciding that he'd be spending every\nmoment with Akir. He lay down on the furs as Talia found a comfortable spot\nagainst the wall to rest her back on. Blade offered that she could lie next to\nhim, but she found it more comfortable to sit up against something.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So... Why do you think someone purposefully burned your house\ndown?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia sighed heavily and closed her eyes. \"You know how I've\nsaid bad people do bad things for no good reason?&#8221; Blade nodded. \"Well, there\nis a group of those bad people that really hate your kind... ferals.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade frowned. \"They hate us? Well, most of the two-legs\nalready hate us anyway.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She shook her head. \"No, I mean <i>really</i> hate you. They think you're just the scum of the Earth with\nno right to live. The fact that your kind lives in this city just means they\nwant to get rid of you so you don't <i>taint</i>\nthe rest of us.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's eyes widened. \"Oh... well then. But why would they\ntarget you? You're a dragonkin.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Because I don't discriminate. They must have noticed you\ntwo living in my house. Whether or not they knew you moved homes, I don't know,\nbut they probably wanted to stop my business anyway.&#8221; She sighed again. \"I lost\nso many supplies...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"We'll help you get them back,&#8221; Blade offered kindly. \"And\nyou can live here as long as you want! We won't mind the company.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia's expression softened as she smiled at him. \"Thank\nyou, Blade. But I'll try to get out of here as soon as I can. I don't want to\nintrude any longer than I have to.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You're not intruding.&#8221; Blade was more than happy to have\nTalia's company. Maybe Akir wouldn't be, but having her around made Blade\nhappy, so he didn't think Akir would complain... much.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia chuckled and shook her head. \"Perhaps not now, but I'm\nsure you two will want some privacy every now and again.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed heatedly and scratched his forearm. He laughed\nnervously and nodded. \"M- Maybe...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia laughed and then yawned, stretching her arms out wide.\nBlade smiled and stood up, thinking it was about time he joined Akir for the\nnight.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm sorry that we don't have another bed... We'll have to get\none for you!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That's not necessary, Blade. These furs will be fine,&#8221; she\nsaid and crawled over to where Blade had been lounging. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Sleep well, Talia,&#8221; he said and slipped into his and Akir's\nbedroom. He stepped up carefully onto the bed and curled up with Akir. He was\nstill fast asleep with a peaceful look on his face. That made Blade smile.\nBlade slowly drifted away, letting the worries of the day fall off of his\nshoulders.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir was bedridden for the rest of the next day. He wasn't\nallowed to move&#8212;Talia's very specific instructions&#8212;so Blade stayed with him for\nmost of the time when he was awake. He had never seen Akir sleep so much\nbefore, but he needed it! And he was very happy to help out by giving Akir food\nand water throughout the day.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Even though he was being pampered, Akir still wanted to\ncomplain. \"Ugh... I don't want to just lie here all day!&#8221; he grumbled. \"I need to\ndo something. I'm feeling restless.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade chuckled as he lay down with Akir. He scooted up close\nand carefully embraced him, his paws at his blue-scaled flanks. \"You heard\nTalia!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He sighed and rolled his eyes. \"I know... And it hurts to\nmove... but it's so <i>boring</i>!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and nuzzled Akir lovingly. \"How do you think I\nfelt when my limbs were broken?&#8221; he teased. But then he felt terrible for\nbringing that up. Akir grimaced and shut up immediately, making Blade's guts\nturn.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"S- Sorry...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"No, it's fine, Blade,&#8221; Akir said and smiled kindly. \"I\nshouldn't be complaining... You had it much worse than I do.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head and firmly buried his snout into Akir's\nneck. \"I didn't mean to make it sound like that...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir weakly chuckled and kissed Blade's head between his\nwhite horns. \"I know, cutie. I love you.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's gold-feathered crest flared out, and he felt his\nchest warm with joy. \"I love you too!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir snuggled with Blade for a moment while he they both\npurred contentedly. Blade loved being close with his mate. It made him feel\nrelaxed and happy.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You know, Blade... Talia's not here right now,&#8221; he cooed with\na hint of lust in his voice.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"B- But you're not feeling well enough for us to...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir sighed and nodded. \"But I'd still like to do a little\nsomething...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wanted to object and say, \"<i>No, you need your rest!&#8221; </i>But a thought popped into his head. He\nsmirked at Akir and started to sensually lick his neck.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I wouldn't mind giving you a little something,&#8221; Blade said\nsoftly as a blush warmed his cheeks. He wasn't used to being the one to initiate\nsex, and just thinking about it made his feathers feel all warm and tingly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir cooed delightedly to Blade and exposed his neck to his\naffections. \"Oh, Blade... Please do...&#8221; Akir huffed and closed his eyes. Blade\nsmiled and traced his tongue down Akir's scales, flicking it across all the\nsensitive places he could find. He stopped at his chest and then slinked down\ntoward the end of the bed. Akir scooted up and winced as he turned slightly\nonto his back, resting most of his weight on his side. He lifted his rear leg\nand spread his hind legs apart.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade couldn't help but to stare at Akir's crotch. His eyes\nwere glued to his drooping, dark-blue nethers. Akir's balls sagged below his\nsheath, and at the tip of his sheath Blade could see his red flesh peeking out,\nglistening with pre.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Go on, Blade,&#8221; Akir cooed and flexed the toes on his hind\npaws. Blade gulped and felt his heart racing in his chest. He lowered his head\nand flared his nostrils, taking in Akir's scent. He buried his snout into his\nmate's nethers, rubbing it along his sheath and package as he sniffed and\nbreathed in heavily through his mouth and nose. He whined and shuddered as his\nlust bloomed inside his head. He could hardly get enough of Akir's strong,\nmusky odor as he nosed firmly around his thick, swelling sheath.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A hot blush warmed Blade's cheeks as his head was buried\nbetween Akir's thighs. He gasped softly and started lapping at Akir's sheath,\nreceiving numerous moans of approval. Blade drew his tongue from the base of\nAkir's sheath and wrapped his tongue over it a he licked up to the tip, briefly\ntasting Akir's tangy flesh before continuing to dote his sheath.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Ooh, Blade...&#8221; Blade could feel Akir's length growing and\nhardening as he watched more of it spill out. He cooed encouragingly to Akir\nand started to lick and curl his tongue around his balls. He lifted each orb\nwith his tongue, playing with them before he lapped and suckled on Akir's\nstones. He watched his cock grow until it twitched and spilled drizzles of his\npre from its tip, his entirety in Blade's view.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You're good at that,&#8221; Akir said softly, smiling down at his\nmate. Blade smiled back, still blushing heatedly as he started to nose at\nAkir's twitching flesh. His nostrils flared as he breathed in even more of\nAkir's scent and rubbed his nose all over it. His aroma was stronger and more\nintoxicating, sending Blade into a lustful fit as he nuzzled Akir's length up\nand down.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir groaned quietly as Blade's tongue flicked out and\ntasted his salty flavor that made his tongue tingle. Blade slathered his wet,\nslimy tongue all over Akir's slick length, coiling and uncoiling it around his\nshaft. He looked up into Akir's sapphire eyes as seductively as he could while\nlapping at his cock.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smirked and chuckled at Blade. \"Mmm, that's nice,\nBlade... I never thought you'd want my cock so much!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed and licked up some accumulated pre from Akir's\ntip, shuddering as his virile flavor clung to his tongue. \"I've b- been wanting\ndo this for a while now,&#8221; Blade admitted and huffed as he licked Akir's tip.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir moaned softly and curled his toes. \"Well, go ahead,\nBlade... Anything you want.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade returned his attention to Akir's flesh, staring at it\nwith lust as he started to lick and lap at it again. He started to gently\nmassage and caress Akir's soft orbs with a paw, squeezing them to draw more\npleasured moans from his mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then Blade parted his maw and carefully went down on Akir's\ncock. He was afraid that he'd accidentally jab him with one of his teeth, so he\ntook it slow. He shuddered and moaned along with Akir, watching his reactions\nas his flesh filled his mouth. Akir shut his eyes tight and lay back, his chest\nrising and falling with his heavy breaths.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh Blade...&#8221; </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade took what he could of Akir's cock, feeling it almost\npushing into his throat. His tongue wrapped around it snugly, pulling it into\nhis maw as he started to suckle on it. He could feel it twitching and pulsing\nas more of Akir's pre drizzled onto the back his tongue. Blade eagerly lapped\nit up while panting over Akir's flesh.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade closed his eyes and relaxed, letting his maw loosen so\nhe could take even more of Akir's thick cock. He was surprised when his nose\nbumped into his crotch, realizing that he fit his mate's entirety in his mouth.\nThe tip of it pushed past his gag reflex, and that made his mouth convulse and\nswallow unintentionally which made Akir gasp and moan loudly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Gods, Blade.... This feels amazing...&#8221; </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Feeling encouraged, Blade swallowed some more around Akir's\ncock, letting his muscles do the work of pleasuring his tip while his tongue\nswirled around the base of his member. He suckled and slurped on it, tasting\nthe pre that oozed out. Akir moaned constantly, basking in the pleasure Blade\nwas giving him. Blade loved every moment of it, too. He loved Akir's cock and\nhe loved pleasing his mate!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Just knowing that he was giving Akir pleasure was enough to\nmake Blade feel elated. He could almost imagine the bliss his mate was feeling\nwith every stroke of his tongue, every suckle between his lips, and the all of\nthe warmth that Akir's cock was buried in.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade started to bob his head slowly, letting Akir's flesh\nslip out of his mouth before it pushed back into his pursed lips. He tilted his\nhead and repeated the motion, and he heard another moan from Akir. Blade looked\nup at him, seeing his head laid back and his eyes closed. His lips were moving as\nhe murmured softly and elicited his pleasure. Blade moaned too, vibrating his\nmouth while he went down on his mate. Blade sucked and slurped, making all\nsorts of lewd sounds with his mouth around Akir's cock.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir slightly squirmed around and worried Blade. Akir wasn't\nsupposed to be moving, but he didn't seem to mind the pain. He was probably\nfeeling too much pleasure to even notice! Blade cast his worries aside and\nfocused on pleasing his mate. He repeatedly bobbed his head in a steady rhythm,\ntaking as much of Akir's cock as he could. Rich, succulent flavor filled\nBlade's maw. He enjoyed Akir's delicious taste, unable to escape it as his\nmeaty cock filled his mouth.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Aaah! B- Blade!&#8221; Akir's forepaw suddenly gripped the back\nof Blade's head between his horns and pushed down. Blade took Akir's entirety\nagain, wincing as it pushed into his throat. Then his eyes bulged as he felt\nthat thick shaft thicken and pulse, spewing the first steamy rope of Akir's\nseed. Blade swallowed hard and gagged as an unrelenting torrent of Akir's\nthick, virile essence filled his maw and throat, some of it oozing down to his\ngullet. The fresh flavor was so much stronger, and Blade loved every bit of it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade didn't resist being forced to choke on Akir's cock. He\nclosed his eyes tight and listened to Akir's husky moans. He eagerly drank his\nmate's seed, letting it fill his maw and throat. Some of it oozed from his lips\nand soiled Akir's scales around his crotch. Blade could feel every throb of his\nmate's cock in his mouth until it finally stopped. He suckled on Akir's flesh\nuntil Akir finally released him. Akir's length slowly slipped from Blade's maw\nas he dragged his tongue up the base of his shaft.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shuddered and panted heavily, his head lolled to the\nside while his tongue stuck out. \"Oh, Blade... That felt so good. Thank you...&#8221;\nBlade cooed happily and lapped at Akir's twitching flesh, cleaning his seed\nfrom it. Akir shuddered and groaned.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You must really love my cock,&#8221; Akir mused, grinning\ntoothily at his mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade licked his lips clean and nodded. He took one last,\nlong gander at Akir's flesh before scooting up and flopping down beside him.\nAkir smirked and pressed his lips to Blade's. Blade blushed as they kissed,\nknowing that Akir would be able to taste himself after Blade's maw had been\ndrenched with his seed. Akir moaned and mingled their tongues together while\nthey exchanged saliva for a brief moment. Then he pulled away and looked into\nBlade's eyes.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade smiled softly at Akir and stroked his flank tenderly.\nAkir's gaze traced Blade's body down until it stopped at his hard, twitching\ncock. Blade blushed profusely, having not even realized how aroused he was. His\nflesh was dripping with pre and twitching needily.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I wish I could help with that,&#8221; Akir said, his voice filled\nwith lust.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nuzzled him, bringing Akir's eyes back up to his. \"I\nhad my fun!&#8221; he said happily, trying to deter Akir from doing anything he\nshouldn't.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir sighed and nodded. \"Still... it's very... tempting.&#8221; Akir's\neyes were glued to Blade's ridged cock, staring at it while Blade didn't bother\nto hide his erection. Blade gulped.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A devious grin spread Akir's lips. \"Stand over me, Blade.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade meeped and shook his head. \"N- No, Akir! We can't...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"C'mon... I know you want to.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed deeply and shook his head. Just the thought of\nAkir pleasuring him... He shuddered, but Akir was already moving. \"N- No! You're\ngoing to hurt yourself!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Then you better stand over me,&#8221; Akir retorted.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gasped as a hind paw suddenly rubbed his cock. Akir's\ntoes curled around his flesh and stroked it up and down the shaft. He pulled\naway and looked at Akir hopelessly. \"Talia is going to kill me,&#8221; he grumbled as\nhe stood up on all fours.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"She doesn't have to know!&#8221; Akir grinned and guided Blade's\nhips over his head. Akir rested the back of his head against the wall, his\nhorns scraping against the stone, while Blade hovered over him. Blade's forepaws rested against the cool\nstone as he half-stood and leaned against the wall, his groin in Akir's face.\nHe immediately felt Akir's warm tongue around his cock and moaned loudly. He\nshuddered and pressed his forehead to the wall, resting it there as Akir worked\nhis flesh up and down.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Th- That feels good, Akir.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It wasn't long before Akir's maw enclosed around Blade's\nmember. He had Blade lightly hump his mouth, and Blade only agreed because it\nwould be easier on him. Blade lost himself in the pleasure, immensely enjoying\nhaving Akir's mouth around his cock. He intently watched himself work his\nlength into Akir's maw while listening to the lewd slurping sounds his mate was\nmaking.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I picked up some heavy bandages to wrap around... his... b-\nback...&#8221; Talia said as she walked into their room, lifting the drape aside. She\nimmediately saw Blade who turned and meeped loudly at seeing her. He tried to\npull away, but Akir growled and grabbed his rear end, holding him there. Blade\nyelped and tried to stop, but Akir didn't want to. He bobbed his head gently\nwhile Blade looked at Talia with horror. He wasn't sure what all she could see,\nbut hearing it was enough!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"A- Ak- Akir!&#8221; Blade stammered, his face flushing with\nembarrassment. Nothing seemed to faze Akir, and he kept going, determined to\nget Blade off. Blade stifled his moans and clenched his teeth.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I told you not to let him move!&#8221; she scolded and glanced at\nthe two of them before rolling her eyes and huffing as she stepped out.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gasped and elicited quiet moans as Akir continued to\npleasure him, unrelenting. His nervousness tried to hold him back, but he couldn't\nhelp but feel his arousal rising rapidly. Having Talia right outside their\nroom, most likely hearing every slurp, moan, and breath they made, was\nembarrassing to say the least! But he quickly lost focus from his worries as\nAkir brought him to an orgasm.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's legs trembled, and he nearly lost his balance.\nPleasure burst through him like fire, warming his shaking body as his cock\nthrobbed and spilled ropes of his seed into Akir's eagerly awaiting maw. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"A- Akir...&#8221; Blade sucked in a breath, trying not to cry out\nhis bliss as Akir sucked him off through his orgasm. As his pleasure died down,\nhe finally was able to catch his breath, but Akir still wouldn't release his\ncock. A tongue kept his sensitive cock twitching and jumping until Blade\nfinally pulled out himself. He panted and glared at Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why didn't you stop?&#8221; he hissed softly, not pleased that\nTalia had caught them during an intimate moment. He kept his voice down, hoping\nTalia couldn't hear them, if she was still in their house.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smirked and groaned as he rolled onto his side. The\nointment on his back looked like it had smeared on the bed, its gross smell now\ntainting the furred sheets. He looked rather pleased with himself as he licked\nhis lips clean.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Because I didn't want to. It's not like that's Talia's\nfirst sexual encounter anyway.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed. His cheeks were still flushed with warmth, and\nhe couldn't tell if it was from the pleasure or from the embarrassment. If he\nhad to look Talia in the eyes again, he wasn't sure if he could do it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Y- You should have stopped... Now she's going to be angry\nthat you didn't listen to her.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shrugged and buried his snout into the bed, resting his\nhead. \"Not my problem,&#8221; he teased. \"Besides, she's living in our house now. We\nget to make the rules!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head. \"She lost her house, Akir... She doesn't\nhave much choice right now.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Neither did we.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You're missing the point!&#8221; Blade huffed. He lay down on his\nbelly and sighed. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir cooed reassuringly to him. \"I'm sorry I upset you,\nBlade... I just wanted to return what you gave me.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and nuzzled Akir affectionately. \"I know... I\nreally enjoyed it,&#8221; Blade admitted with a toothy smile. \"But you should rest\nnow. We can get those bandages on later.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir dipped his head and rolled onto his side with his arms\nstretched open. \"Lie with me, Blade.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade didn't quite feel like napping; he wanted to go talk\nto Talia and reassure her that they didn't do anything strenuous for Akir. But\nhe lay with his mate anyway, letting his body curl around him as his back was\npressed to Akir's warm belly. He'd rather be comfortable with Akir than\nextremely uncomfortable with Talia while he tried to explain what they were\ndoing!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade tucked his wings closely to his body and purred as\nAkir affectionately cuddled with him, wrapping an arm around Blade's stomach\nwhile the other scratched and stroked the feathers along his head. He pulled\nBlade close and nuzzled his neck lovingly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade melted with bliss, purring as his mate gently caressed\nhim. It was a pleasure he had never felt before, and it was all his for the\ntaking. He enjoyed every heavenly second while Akir lovingly petted him until\nhis strokes became slower as Akir drifted into slumber.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Soft snores rumbled in Akir's throat as he fell asleep.\nBlade took a deep, steady breath and felt himself starting to slip into slumber\ntoo. To his surprise, he instantly felt exhausted. He let his mind wander to\nwarm thoughts of Akir until he was dreaming.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n</span>\n </body>\n</html>\n"

    "content": "SMOKE AND FIRE\n\nRising into the sky was a dark, black cloud of smoke that unfurled in the wind.\nBlade could see it from their house. The cloud was twisting and turning over the\neastern side of the city. He watched it curiously and sniffed the air. He\ncouldn't smell anything from here, but he swore he could faintly smell the smoke\nin the breeze.\n\nAkir opened the door and came out, wondering what Blade was doing. He sidled\nalong beside him and looked where Blade was looking. They weren't the only two\nlooking over in that direction. There were many ferals stopped in their tracks,\npeering over the houses and buildings. Despite the desert being hotter than any\nplace in the world, fires were extremely rare.\n\n\"Oh wow,” Akir said. \"What do you think caught fire?”\n\nBlade shrugged his feathered wings. \"I don't know. It doesn't seem all that big\nthough. Might just be a cart or two. Want to go look?” Akir nodded, so they\nleapt into the skies and flew to the east.\n\nAs they climbed higher into the sky, Blade could make out that the smoke was\ncoming from the housing districts, and it looked like it was on the edge of the\neastern-most part of the districts. A sinking feeling gripped his stomach the\ncloser they got.\n\n\"A- Akir? That... that isn't...”\n\nAkir looked very concerned too. They couldn't see much of anything beneath the\nmalevolent black smoke as they flew over it, but they recognized the surrounding\narea all too well. They had found themselves living in this area for some time\nup until just a month or so ago. And Blade knew of only one wooden building\naround: Talia's house.\n\nBlade's heart pounded anxiously in his chest as he dropped down and landed\nheavily. There was a crowd of two-legs around that peered at him uneasily, but\nTalia wasn't in sight. Akir landed shortly after, but Blade didn't want to wait\naround.\n\n\"Blade!” Akir shouted as Blade tore off toward the fire. Blade ignored him and\nslipped into the obscuring smog. He had to find Talia. He had to make sure she\nwas alright.\n\nHe coughed and felt his eyes stinging as he got closer. The smoldering, burning\nsmell was too pungent for his nostrils, making them burn. Flames flickered\nwithin the blackness that surrounded him. They flashed and caught his eye,\nsending a deep-rooted fear blazing in his mind. He trembled as the heat caressed\nhis feathers threateningly.\n\nSomething snapped inside him, as if the fire brought a familiar sense of fear\ninto his fleeting heart. He couldn't understand it, but he felt like he had seen\na fire like this before. It was as if there were memories playing through his\nmind all over again, flickering through his vision just like the flame itself.\n\nHe stood outside the burning remains of Talia's home, hypnotized with terror.\nThoughts passed his mind in the blink of an eye until he finally snapped back to\nreality. What could have caused this?\n\nHe winced as he listened to the roaring of the fire. Wood snapped and collapsed\nwhile the flames ate the house alive. He hoped and hoped that Talia wasn't in\nthere. If she was, he knew she wouldn't survive.\n\nBlade had no idea where the sudden courage came from, but he surged forward. He\ncouldn't lose Talia; he couldn't lose the only other person in the world that\ntruly cared for him aside from Akir. If she was in there, he would save her.\n\nBut just before he could get close enough to the burning building, Akir tackled\nhim and pinned him down. \"Blade! What the hell are you thinking!?”\n\nBlade growled and tried to push Akir off. The heat was intense, and he could\nalmost feel it scalding his feathers.\n\n\"I have to save her!”\n\nAkir growled and firmly shoved Blade down as a loud crack sounded behind them\nand hunched over him. Blade watched in horror as the force of whatever collapsed\nsent flames billowing out from the solid doorframe several feet away. Akir\nfanned out his wings to protect Blade. Blade suddenly felt the heat of the fire\nleave his face as he watched Akir wince with pain and yelp.\n\nFear gripped Blade. He froze, his golden eyes lit with the dancing flames behind\nAkir. He could see them threateningly growing closer. Akir growled and dragged\nBlade away until they were on the other side of the street. He collapsed beside\nhim, seeming to be trying to catch his breath, but there was too much smoke\nfilling both of their lungs.\n\nBlade still couldn't move. He coughed and wheezed, feeling sick to his stomach.\nHis lungs and throat hurta stinging pain filled his head.\n\n\"You stupid idiots!” A familiar voice growled beside him. Blade broke free from\nhis stupor and watched as Talia grabbed Akir's wings and tugged on them as she\ndragged him away. Blade meeped weakly and crawled after them, but it wasn't long\nbefore Talia came back and dragged him away too.\n\nShe took them out of the smoke in front of the growing crowd. Blade could almost\nfeel their gazes focused on the two ferals and the two-leg helping them.\n\n\"Stupid, stupid, stupid,” Talia grumbled under her breath. Blade coughed some\nmore while his head started to clear. His heart fluttered inside his chest\nrapidly, unable to stop as adrenaline coursed through him. Had he almost died?\n\nHe looked at Akir and horror gripped him. Akir's scales along his back were\nblack. What were once deep-blue scales with a mixture of dappled purple blotches\nwere now scorched badly. Blade whimpered and crawled over to him. Akir hissed\nand growled through clenched teeth.\n\n\"What were you two thinking?” Talia growled. \"You almost got yourselves killed\nfor no reason!”\n\n\"I... I was going to s- save you...” Blade said. He was too focused on Akir to\nsee Talia's furious glare. He wanted to hold Akir tight and never let go, but\nafter just a brief touch Akir hissed and growled with pain.\n\nBut he could hear her sigh. \"Where do you two live? We need to get him out of\nhere and treat his burns.”\n\nBlade stared at Akir with worry. He'd never seen Akir hurt so badly... Akir\nnever got hurt. It was always Blade who got himself into trouble, but this time\nBlade got Akir into trouble. He felt terrible. His stomach flipped around inside\nhim and twisted itself into a knot as he trembled. Now he knew how Akir had\nfelt, but he felt worse than that. This was his fault.\n\nBlade and Talia helped Akir to his paws, almost carrying his heavy weight until\nthey found a cart. Two-legs stared at them from all around without giving much\nof a thought to help. Without hesitating, Talia dumped the cart's contents and\nBlade helped her lift Akir into it. They wheeled it away after hearing a\ndisgruntled wolf growling insults—the owner of that cart. Blade turned and\ngrowled back at him with his fangs bared. Intimidation wasn't Blade's forte, but\nhe would do anything for Akir. Nevertheless, the wolf backed off.\n\nIt was the longest walk of Blade's life. They took Akir all the way back to\ntheir home in the feral district. He had passed out on the way, so they lifted\nhim out and half-dragged him inside. Blade arranged their bedding in the main\nliving area, and with Talia's help they laid him on his belly.\n\n\"W- What are we going to do?” Blade asked anxiously, staring at the burns along\nAkir's back. A sick, twisting feeling gripped his stomach. Akir was in pain.\n\n\"I don't know. I need to make a salve to help his scales heal. He's fine for\nnow, and he's at no risk of dying,” she assured Blade.\n\nBlade nodded, feeling slightly relieved. \"What do you need?”\n\nTalia sighed. \"This would be much easier had my house not burned down... I'll\nneed lavender in whatever form you can get it, preferably oil. That's the\npriority, but I'll also need honey, coconut oil, and the sap of a Godswood tree.\nYou can find all of these at an herb shop in the market district. It's a small\nbuilding next to a jewelry and linen stall.”\n\nBlade nodded again and grabbed his satchel with some money. He had Talia repeat\nthe list back to him before he quickly left and took to the skies.\n\nWhen he returned, Talia had placed wet rags along Akir's back. He gave her\neverything she needed, including a mortar and pestle he had also bought. He was\nproud of himself for thinking ahead on that, as he knew they didn't have\nanything like that in their home. She regarded him thoughtfully and started\nmixing the herbs together.\n\n\"How did this happen?” she asked as she stirred.\n\nBlade sat down on his haunches. \"He protected me from a sudden burst of\nflames... I... I was being stupid.” He gritted his teeth, remembering that this\nwas entirely his fault. He wanted to go save someone who didn't need rescuing.\nHe let his emotions get the better of him again, and Akir got hurt because of\nit.\n\n\"I must have been turned around when you two ran into the smoke. I heard gasps\nand shouts as two feral dragons ran toward the fire. As soon as I could I ran\nafter you two, but I guess I was too late.”\n\nBlade gulped and nodded. \"I thought you were still in there...”\n\nShe shook her head. \"No, I was out shopping when it happened. It was quite the\nsurprise,” she hissed.\n\n\"How did it happen?”\n\nTalia tensed. \"I don't know... I didn't have anything that could cause a fire. I\nexpected that house to collapse on its own before it burned down.”\n\n\"So it just caught fire?” Blade asked disbelievingly.\n\nTalia pondered for a moment as if questioning herself whether or not to tell\nBlade something. \"I think it was deliberate.”\n\nBlade's ears flicked nervously. \"Who would do that!?”\n\nShe shrugged as if someone burning her home down didn't even matter. \"I don't\nknow. It's just a hunch.”\n\n\"You think someone burned your house down because they wanted to?” Blade\ncouldn't imagine anyone wanting to burn her house down. Talia was very nice...\nonce you got to know her, but she was also a healer. Blade wasn't the only one\nshe had fixed up in the last year: there were plenty of others, mostly two-legs.\n\n\"Like I said, it's just a hu—” Akir groaned and wheezed as he woke up. \"Hey,\nhey! Don't move!” She held Akir's neck down, making him wince and growl.\n\nBlade immediately went to see Akir's face, sitting down in front of him as his\ntorso leaned down. He nuzzled Akir's snout lovingly to comfort him, looking into\nhis eyes with concern etched into his face. Akir smiled weakly back and licked\nBlade's nose.\n\n\"How long was I out?” Akir asked. He lay still, deciding that it was his best\ninterest to stay put for now.\n\n\"About an hour or so,” Talia answered and returned to stirring her remedy\ntogether.\n\n\"Are you feeling okay?” Blade asked worriedly.\n\nAkir nodded and sighed. \"It could be worse.”\n\n\"I'm... I'm sorry, Akir...” Blade started to tear up again, thinking about the\npain Akir was in because of him.\n\nAkir scowled at Blade and elicited a terse growl. \"Don't be, Blade.”\n\n\"B- But you're hurt because of me!” he sobbed and sniffled, wiping his tears.\n\"It's my fault that you were burned...” Akir growled and hissed as he struggled\nto stand.\n\n\"I said NOT to move!” Talia scolded. But Akir didn't listen to her. He winced\nand grimaced through the pain, stepping forward until he wrapped his torso and\nwings around Blade. His breath was quick and Blade could feel how hot his scales\nwere against his feathers.\n\n\"Akir...” Blade nestled into his embrace as Akir pulled him close. He licked\nBlade's neck affectionately and purred despite the pain wracking his body.\n\n\"It's my job to protect you, Blade. I will gladly put myself in harm's way if it\nmeans you will be safe.” He squeezed Blade tight and finished, \"I am your mate.”\n\nBlade whimpered and buried his snout into his blue scales. \"I- I don't want you\nto get hurt because of me!”\n\n\"I'm...” Akir breathed heavily with pained hisses. \"I'm fine, Blade...” Then his\nweight suddenly dropped on Blade. Blade meeped and held Akir up as he gently\nlaid him back down. He looked anxiously at Talia who rushed over with a wet rag\nand placed it on Akir's forehead.\n\nShe sighed and shook her head. \"Stupid idiot. He overexerted himself. He's got a\nterrible fever, too.”\n\nBlade watched uneasily. He fidgeted around and clawed at the ground while quiet\nwhimpers escaped his lips. \"Is he going to be alright?”\n\nTalia nodded and started applying the concoction along Akir's back. It looked\ngooey and sticky, clinging to his scales. \"He just needs to rest right now and\nnot move.”\n\nBlade lay down in front of Akir, keeping a close eye on him. Despite Talia's\nconstant reassurance, he felt the opposite. He wanted to hug and squeeze the\npain right out of his mate, but he knew that would just make his condition a lot\nworse!\n\nSo, he restlessly watched Akir, even after Talia had retired for the night. She\nhad nowhere else to go, so she would stay with them until she found a new home.\nIt was the least they could do!\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Akir woke again, Blade and Talia helped him to the bed. He thanked them and\nfell fast asleep again as he sprawled out on his side. The salve seemed to be\nhelping, though it did smell rather potent.\n\n\"When do you think he'll be healed?” Blade asked as he and Talia returned to\ntheir living area.\n\n\"It should take about a week or two for the pain to subside. He'll be able to\nwalk around more in a couple of days, though it'll be uncomfortable.”\n\nBlade nodded, already deciding that he'd be spending every moment with Akir. He\nlay down on the furs as Talia found a comfortable spot against the wall to rest\nher back on. Blade offered that she could lie next to him, but she found it more\ncomfortable to sit up against something.\n\n\"So... Why do you think someone purposefully burned your house down?”\n\nTalia sighed heavily and closed her eyes. \"You know how I've said bad people do\nbad things for no good reason?” Blade nodded. \"Well, there is a group of those\nbad people that really hate your kind... ferals.”\n\nBlade frowned. \"They hate us? Well, most of the two-legs already hate us\nanyway.”\n\nShe shook her head. \"No, I mean really hate you. They think you're just the scum\nof the Earth with no right to live. The fact that your kind lives in this city\njust means they want to get rid of you so you don't taint the rest of us.”\n\nBlade's eyes widened. \"Oh... well then. But why would they target you? You're a\ndragonkin.”\n\n\"Because I don't discriminate. They must have noticed you two living in my\nhouse. Whether or not they knew you moved homes, I don't know, but they probably\nwanted to stop my business anyway.” She sighed again. \"I lost so many\nsupplies...”\n\n\"We'll help you get them back,” Blade offered kindly. \"And you can live here as\nlong as you want! We won't mind the company.”\n\nTalia's expression softened as she smiled at him. \"Thank you, Blade. But I'll\ntry to get out of here as soon as I can. I don't want to intrude any longer than\nI have to.”\n\n\"You're not intruding.” Blade was more than happy to have Talia's company. Maybe\nAkir wouldn't be, but having her around made Blade happy, so he didn't think\nAkir would complain... much.\n\nTalia chuckled and shook her head. \"Perhaps not now, but I'm sure you two will\nwant some privacy every now and again.”\n\nBlade blushed heatedly and scratched his forearm. He laughed nervously and\nnodded. \"M- Maybe...”\n\nTalia laughed and then yawned, stretching her arms out wide. Blade smiled and\nstood up, thinking it was about time he joined Akir for the night.\n\n\"I'm sorry that we don't have another bed... We'll have to get one for you!”\n\n\"That's not necessary, Blade. These furs will be fine,” she said and crawled\nover to where Blade had been lounging.\n\n\"Sleep well, Talia,” he said and slipped into his and Akir's bedroom. He stepped\nup carefully onto the bed and curled up with Akir. He was still fast asleep with\na peaceful look on his face. That made Blade smile. Blade slowly drifted away,\nletting the worries of the day fall off of his shoulders.\n\n* * *\n\nAkir was bedridden for the rest of the next day. He wasn't allowed to\nmove—Talia's very specific instructions—so Blade stayed with him for most of the\ntime when he was awake. He had never seen Akir sleep so much before, but he\nneeded it! And he was very happy to help out by giving Akir food and water\nthroughout the day.\n\nEven though he was being pampered, Akir still wanted to complain. \"Ugh... I\ndon't want to just lie here all day!” he grumbled. \"I need to do something. I'm\nfeeling restless.”\n\nBlade chuckled as he lay down with Akir. He scooted up close and carefully\nembraced him, his paws at his blue-scaled flanks. \"You heard Talia!”\n\nHe sighed and rolled his eyes. \"I know... And it hurts to move... but it's so\nboring!”\n\nBlade giggled and nuzzled Akir lovingly. \"How do you think I felt when my limbs\nwere broken?” he teased. But then he felt terrible for bringing that up. Akir\ngrimaced and shut up immediately, making Blade's guts turn.\n\n\"S- Sorry...”\n\n\"No, it's fine, Blade,” Akir said and smiled kindly. \"I shouldn't be\ncomplaining... You had it much worse than I do.”\n\nBlade shook his head and firmly buried his snout into Akir's neck. \"I didn't\nmean to make it sound like that...”\n\nAkir weakly chuckled and kissed Blade's head between his white horns. \"I know,\ncutie. I love you.”\n\nBlade's gold-feathered crest flared out, and he felt his chest warm with joy. \"I\nlove you too!”\n\nAkir snuggled with Blade for a moment while he they both purred contentedly.\nBlade loved being close with his mate. It made him feel relaxed and happy.\n\n\"You know, Blade... Talia's not here right now,” he cooed with a hint of lust in\nhis voice.\n\n\"B- But you're not feeling well enough for us to...”\n\nAkir sighed and nodded. \"But I'd still like to do a little something...”\n\nBlade wanted to object and say, \"No, you need your rest!” But a thought popped\ninto his head. He smirked at Akir and started to sensually lick his neck.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind giving you a little something,” Blade said softly as a blush\nwarmed his cheeks. He wasn't used to being the one to initiate sex, and just\nthinking about it made his feathers feel all warm and tingly.\n\nAkir cooed delightedly to Blade and exposed his neck to his affections. \"Oh,\nBlade... Please do...” Akir huffed and closed his eyes. Blade smiled and traced\nhis tongue down Akir's scales, flicking it across all the sensitive places he\ncould find. He stopped at his chest and then slinked down toward the end of the\nbed. Akir scooted up and winced as he turned slightly onto his back, resting\nmost of his weight on his side. He lifted his rear leg and spread his hind legs\napart.\n\nBlade couldn't help but to stare at Akir's crotch. His eyes were glued to his\ndrooping, dark-blue nethers. Akir's balls sagged below his sheath, and at the\ntip of his sheath Blade could see his red flesh peeking out, glistening with\npre.\n\n\"Go on, Blade,” Akir cooed and flexed the toes on his hind paws. Blade gulped\nand felt his heart racing in his chest. He lowered his head and flared his\nnostrils, taking in Akir's scent. He buried his snout into his mate's nethers,\nrubbing it along his sheath and package as he sniffed and breathed in heavily\nthrough his mouth and nose. He whined and shuddered as his lust bloomed inside\nhis head. He could hardly get enough of Akir's strong, musky odor as he nosed\nfirmly around his thick, swelling sheath.\n\nA hot blush warmed Blade's cheeks as his head was buried between Akir's thighs.\nHe gasped softly and started lapping at Akir's sheath, receiving numerous moans\nof approval. Blade drew his tongue from the base of Akir's sheath and wrapped\nhis tongue over it a he licked up to the tip, briefly tasting Akir's tangy flesh\nbefore continuing to dote his sheath.\n\n\"Ooh, Blade...” Blade could feel Akir's length growing and hardening as he\nwatched more of it spill out. He cooed encouragingly to Akir and started to lick\nand curl his tongue around his balls. He lifted each orb with his tongue,\nplaying with them before he lapped and suckled on Akir's stones. He watched his\ncock grow until it twitched and spilled drizzles of his pre from its tip, his\nentirety in Blade's view.\n\n\"You're good at that,” Akir said softly, smiling down at his mate. Blade smiled\nback, still blushing heatedly as he started to nose at Akir's twitching flesh.\nHis nostrils flared as he breathed in even more of Akir's scent and rubbed his\nnose all over it. His aroma was stronger and more intoxicating, sending Blade\ninto a lustful fit as he nuzzled Akir's length up and down.\n\nAkir groaned quietly as Blade's tongue flicked out and tasted his salty flavor\nthat made his tongue tingle. Blade slathered his wet, slimy tongue all over\nAkir's slick length, coiling and uncoiling it around his shaft. He looked up\ninto Akir's sapphire eyes as seductively as he could while lapping at his cock.\n\nAkir smirked and chuckled at Blade. \"Mmm, that's nice, Blade... I never thought\nyou'd want my cock so much!”\n\nBlade blushed and licked up some accumulated pre from Akir's tip, shuddering as\nhis virile flavor clung to his tongue. \"I've b- been wanting do this for a while\nnow,” Blade admitted and huffed as he licked Akir's tip.\n\nAkir moaned softly and curled his toes. \"Well, go ahead, Blade... Anything you\nwant.”\n\nBlade returned his attention to Akir's flesh, staring at it with lust as he\nstarted to lick and lap at it again. He started to gently massage and caress\nAkir's soft orbs with a paw, squeezing them to draw more pleasured moans from\nhis mate.\n\nThen Blade parted his maw and carefully went down on Akir's cock. He was afraid\nthat he'd accidentally jab him with one of his teeth, so he took it slow. He\nshuddered and moaned along with Akir, watching his reactions as his flesh filled\nhis mouth. Akir shut his eyes tight and lay back, his chest rising and falling\nwith his heavy breaths.\n\n\"Oh Blade...”\n\nBlade took what he could of Akir's cock, feeling it almost pushing into his\nthroat. His tongue wrapped around it snugly, pulling it into his maw as he\nstarted to suckle on it. He could feel it twitching and pulsing as more of\nAkir's pre drizzled onto the back his tongue. Blade eagerly lapped it up while\npanting over Akir's flesh.\n\nBlade closed his eyes and relaxed, letting his maw loosen so he could take even\nmore of Akir's thick cock. He was surprised when his nose bumped into his\ncrotch, realizing that he fit his mate's entirety in his mouth. The tip of it\npushed past his gag reflex, and that made his mouth convulse and swallow\nunintentionally which made Akir gasp and moan loudly.\n\n\"Gods, Blade.... This feels amazing...”\n\nFeeling encouraged, Blade swallowed some more around Akir's cock, letting his\nmuscles do the work of pleasuring his tip while his tongue swirled around the\nbase of his member. He suckled and slurped on it, tasting the pre that oozed\nout. Akir moaned constantly, basking in the pleasure Blade was giving him. Blade\nloved every moment of it, too. He loved Akir's cock and he loved pleasing his\nmate!\n\nJust knowing that he was giving Akir pleasure was enough to make Blade feel\nelated. He could almost imagine the bliss his mate was feeling with every stroke\nof his tongue, every suckle between his lips, and the all of the warmth that\nAkir's cock was buried in.\n\nBlade started to bob his head slowly, letting Akir's flesh slip out of his mouth\nbefore it pushed back into his pursed lips. He tilted his head and repeated the\nmotion, and he heard another moan from Akir. Blade looked up at him, seeing his\nhead laid back and his eyes closed. His lips were moving as he murmured softly\nand elicited his pleasure. Blade moaned too, vibrating his mouth while he went\ndown on his mate. Blade sucked and slurped, making all sorts of lewd sounds with\nhis mouth around Akir's cock.\n\nAkir slightly squirmed around and worried Blade. Akir wasn't supposed to be\nmoving, but he didn't seem to mind the pain. He was probably feeling too much\npleasure to even notice! Blade cast his worries aside and focused on pleasing\nhis mate. He repeatedly bobbed his head in a steady rhythm, taking as much of\nAkir's cock as he could. Rich, succulent flavor filled Blade's maw. He enjoyed\nAkir's delicious taste, unable to escape it as his meaty cock filled his mouth.\n\n\"Aaah! B- Blade!” Akir's forepaw suddenly gripped the back of Blade's head\nbetween his horns and pushed down. Blade took Akir's entirety again, wincing as\nit pushed into his throat. Then his eyes bulged as he felt that thick shaft\nthicken and pulse, spewing the first steamy rope of Akir's seed. Blade swallowed\nhard and gagged as an unrelenting torrent of Akir's thick, virile essence filled\nhis maw and throat, some of it oozing down to his gullet. The fresh flavor was\nso much stronger, and Blade loved every bit of it.\n\nBlade didn't resist being forced to choke on Akir's cock. He closed his eyes\ntight and listened to Akir's husky moans. He eagerly drank his mate's seed,\nletting it fill his maw and throat. Some of it oozed from his lips and soiled\nAkir's scales around his crotch. Blade could feel every throb of his mate's cock\nin his mouth until it finally stopped. He suckled on Akir's flesh until Akir\nfinally released him. Akir's length slowly slipped from Blade's maw as he\ndragged his tongue up the base of his shaft.\n\nAkir shuddered and panted heavily, his head lolled to the side while his tongue\nstuck out. \"Oh, Blade... That felt so good. Thank you...” Blade cooed happily\nand lapped at Akir's twitching flesh, cleaning his seed from it. Akir shuddered\nand groaned.\n\n\"You must really love my cock,” Akir mused, grinning toothily at his mate.\n\nBlade licked his lips clean and nodded. He took one last, long gander at Akir's\nflesh before scooting up and flopping down beside him. Akir smirked and pressed\nhis lips to Blade's. Blade blushed as they kissed, knowing that Akir would be\nable to taste himself after Blade's maw had been drenched with his seed. Akir\nmoaned and mingled their tongues together while they exchanged saliva for a\nbrief moment. Then he pulled away and looked into Blade's eyes.\n\nBlade smiled softly at Akir and stroked his flank tenderly. Akir's gaze traced\nBlade's body down until it stopped at his hard, twitching cock. Blade blushed\nprofusely, having not even realized how aroused he was. His flesh was dripping\nwith pre and twitching needily.\n\n\"I wish I could help with that,” Akir said, his voice filled with lust.\n\nBlade nuzzled him, bringing Akir's eyes back up to his. \"I had my fun!” he said\nhappily, trying to deter Akir from doing anything he shouldn't.\n\nAkir sighed and nodded. \"Still... it's very... tempting.” Akir's eyes were glued\nto Blade's ridged cock, staring at it while Blade didn't bother to hide his\nerection. Blade gulped.\n\nA devious grin spread Akir's lips. \"Stand over me, Blade.”\n\nBlade meeped and shook his head. \"N- No, Akir! We can't...”\n\n\"C'mon... I know you want to.”\n\nBlade blushed deeply and shook his head. Just the thought of Akir pleasuring\nhim... He shuddered, but Akir was already moving. \"N- No! You're going to hurt\nyourself!”\n\n\"Then you better stand over me,” Akir retorted.\n\nBlade gasped as a hind paw suddenly rubbed his cock. Akir's toes curled around\nhis flesh and stroked it up and down the shaft. He pulled away and looked at\nAkir hopelessly. \"Talia is going to kill me,” he grumbled as he stood up on all\nfours.\n\n\"She doesn't have to know!” Akir grinned and guided Blade's hips over his head.\nAkir rested the back of his head against the wall, his horns scraping against\nthe stone, while Blade hovered over him. Blade's forepaws rested against the\ncool stone as he half-stood and leaned against the wall, his groin in Akir's\nface. He immediately felt Akir's warm tongue around his cock and moaned loudly.\nHe shuddered and pressed his forehead to the wall, resting it there as Akir\nworked his flesh up and down.\n\n\"Th- That feels good, Akir.”\n\nIt wasn't long before Akir's maw enclosed around Blade's member. He had Blade\nlightly hump his mouth, and Blade only agreed because it would be easier on him.\nBlade lost himself in the pleasure, immensely enjoying having Akir's mouth\naround his cock. He intently watched himself work his length into Akir's maw\nwhile listening to the lewd slurping sounds his mate was making.\n\n\"I picked up some heavy bandages to wrap around... his... b- back...” Talia said\nas she walked into their room, lifting the drape aside. She immediately saw\nBlade who turned and meeped loudly at seeing her. He tried to pull away, but\nAkir growled and grabbed his rear end, holding him there. Blade yelped and tried\nto stop, but Akir didn't want to. He bobbed his head gently while Blade looked\nat Talia with horror. He wasn't sure what all she could see, but hearing it was\nenough!\n\n\"A- Ak- Akir!” Blade stammered, his face flushing with embarrassment. Nothing\nseemed to faze Akir, and he kept going, determined to get Blade off. Blade\nstifled his moans and clenched his teeth.\n\n\"I told you not to let him move!” she scolded and glanced at the two of them\nbefore rolling her eyes and huffing as she stepped out.\n\nBlade gasped and elicited quiet moans as Akir continued to pleasure him,\nunrelenting. His nervousness tried to hold him back, but he couldn't help but\nfeel his arousal rising rapidly. Having Talia right outside their room, most\nlikely hearing every slurp, moan, and breath they made, was embarrassing to say\nthe least! But he quickly lost focus from his worries as Akir brought him to an\norgasm.\n\nBlade's legs trembled, and he nearly lost his balance. Pleasure burst through\nhim like fire, warming his shaking body as his cock throbbed and spilled ropes\nof his seed into Akir's eagerly awaiting maw.\n\n\"A- Akir...” Blade sucked in a breath, trying not to cry out his bliss as Akir\nsucked him off through his orgasm. As his pleasure died down, he finally was\nable to catch his breath, but Akir still wouldn't release his cock. A tongue\nkept his sensitive cock twitching and jumping until Blade finally pulled out\nhimself. He panted and glared at Akir.\n\n\"Why didn't you stop?” he hissed softly, not pleased that Talia had caught them\nduring an intimate moment. He kept his voice down, hoping Talia couldn't hear\nthem, if she was still in their house.\n\nAkir smirked and groaned as he rolled onto his side. The ointment on his back\nlooked like it had smeared on the bed, its gross smell now tainting the furred\nsheets. He looked rather pleased with himself as he licked his lips clean.\n\n\"Because I didn't want to. It's not like that's Talia's first sexual encounter\nanyway.”\n\nBlade sighed. His cheeks were still flushed with warmth, and he couldn't tell if\nit was from the pleasure or from the embarrassment. If he had to look Talia in\nthe eyes again, he wasn't sure if he could do it.\n\n\"Y- You should have stopped... Now she's going to be angry that you didn't\nlisten to her.”\n\nAkir shrugged and buried his snout into the bed, resting his head. \"Not my\nproblem,” he teased. \"Besides, she's living in our house now. We get to make the\nrules!”\n\nBlade shook his head. \"She lost her house, Akir... She doesn't have much choice\nright now.”\n\n\"Neither did we.”\n\n\"You're missing the point!” Blade huffed. He lay down on his belly and sighed.\n\nAkir cooed reassuringly to him. \"I'm sorry I upset you, Blade... I just wanted\nto return what you gave me.”\n\nBlade nodded and nuzzled Akir affectionately. \"I know... I really enjoyed it,”\nBlade admitted with a toothy smile. \"But you should rest now. We can get those\nbandages on later.”\n\nAkir dipped his head and rolled onto his side with his arms stretched open. \"Lie\nwith me, Blade.”\n\nBlade didn't quite feel like napping; he wanted to go talk to Talia and reassure\nher that they didn't do anything strenuous for Akir. But he lay with his mate\nanyway, letting his body curl around him as his back was pressed to Akir's warm\nbelly. He'd rather be comfortable with Akir than extremely uncomfortable with\nTalia while he tried to explain what they were doing!\n\nBlade tucked his wings closely to his body and purred as Akir affectionately\ncuddled with him, wrapping an arm around Blade's stomach while the other\nscratched and stroked the feathers along his head. He pulled Blade close and\nnuzzled his neck lovingly.\n\nBlade melted with bliss, purring as his mate gently caressed him. It was a\npleasure he had never felt before, and it was all his for the taking. He enjoyed\nevery heavenly second while Akir lovingly petted him until his strokes became\nslower as Akir drifted into slumber.\n\nSoft snores rumbled in Akir's throat as he fell asleep. Blade took a deep,\nsteady breath and felt himself starting to slip into slumber too. To his\nsurprise, he instantly felt exhausted. He let his mind wander to warm thoughts\nof Akir until he was dreaming."
