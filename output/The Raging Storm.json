The cute, black-feathered hatchling was making meeping sounds while\nshe slept, and she had a dragon tucked against her body too. The toy plushy was\nnestled in her embrace as she squeezed around it. That made Blade smile giddily\nas he held her just a little closer. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir wasn't with them and must have woken up to go\nsomewhere. Ever since Asha had hatched, he had been acting much more\nadult-like. He didn't laze around as much as he used to, and he seemed to be\nconstantly worrying about something, which, in turn, made Blade worried.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But whenever Blade would ask Akir about it, Akir would just shrug it off and\nsay it was nothing.\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade knew something was wrong, but Akir would only get\nangry if he pressed him for more information. Blade wished that his mate would\ntalk to him, but Akir still seemed as happy as ever, especially when he was\naround Asha.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It warmed Blade's heart to see that proud smile that would often\ncurl Akir's lips. He, too, felt very proud and joyful to have his adorable\nhatchling in his arms. She was everything he had dreamed of, and he couldn't\nwait to see her grow up. He hoped that she would grow into a beautiful\ndragoness, but not <i>too</i> beautiful that\nshe would have males constantly hounding after her.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">With her being just a month or two old, Blade didn't have to\nbe concerned about that yet! </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha made a small, squeaking sound and yawned, baring her\nvery tiny but sharp teeth. Then she looked up at her father, who had a huge\nsmile across his muzzle.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Good morning, sweetie,\" Blade said and affectionately\nlicked her nose. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha squeaked back as her feathers puffed out, making Blade\ngiggle. He nuzzled her and held her tight in his arms. She wiggled and meeped\nbefore yawning widely again. Blade had to let her go before she wrenched\nherself out of his grasp.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha stretched out on the bed, baring her tiny claws and\nflicking her cute, lengthy tail. Blade grinned and hopped off of the bed, stretching\nout too and making a ramp for her to climb down from. She wasn't so small that\nshe'd hurt herself jumping off, but he liked making it safer for her anyway.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She made another cute squeaking sound and climbed down\nBlade's back. Blade winced as one of her sharp claws pricked his hide, but he\ngrinned as she climbed onto his head and laid there between his horns. He\nlooked up at her, seeing her smiling face looking down at him with her head\ncocked to the side.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So, it's one of those days again?\" Blade said and chuckled.\n\"Okay, but don't fall off this time!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha squeaked her affirmative answer and held tightly to her\nfather, her limbs wrapping around his head. Blade stepped out into the living\nroom and saw Akir lying on the furs, looking to be deep in thought about\nsomething. His brow was furrowed and his tail was swishing back and forth.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Morning, Akir,\" Blade said. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha peeped and wriggled furiously at seeing her other\nfather. Akir turned his head, and his stressful expression immediately vanished\nand was replaced by a warm smile.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Good morning, cuties,\" he said. \"I see that Asha is feeling\nrowdy again today.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade half-nodded, trying not to shake his daughter off of his\nhead. His neck slightly ached from holding her there, making him realize that\nshe was getting bigger. \"I'll be sad when she's too big for this.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled. \"Sadly, it won't be too long at the rate she\nis growing. Still, it's really cute!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade smiled toothily and sat sejant next to his mate with\ntheir hatchling squeaking excitedly on top of him, clinging to her father's\nhead tightly. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What were you thinking about?\" Blade asked and squeezed\nAkir's paw lovingly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's face shifted unpleasantly. \"Nothing you need to worry\nabout... Hey, why don't you go get some food for us today at the market? Take\nAsha with you.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade noticed something stirring in Akir's expression. His\ntalons twitched and his tail was still swishing behind him, sliding across the\nstone floor. Something was pressing at Akir's mind, but Blade couldn't figure\nout what it was. More than anything, Akir looked nervous. Blade had never seen\nAkir act nervous before...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What's wrong, Akir?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head as if to rid himself of his thoughts. \"I\nsaid it was nothing. We could use some fruit, if you wouldn't mind. Asha likes\nthe starfruit best.\" He changed the subject immediately, directing Blade away\nfrom the problem&#8212;a common tactic for him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade peered at Akir and then looked up at Asha who seemed\nto recognize the name of her favorite fruit because she gave a loud meep.\n\"You're not coming along?\" Blade asked worriedly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"No. Not this time, Blade. You'll be fine. Just make sure\nyou keep Asha close to you at all times.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's eyes met Akir's, and he saw something in those deep-blue\norbs that swirled and twisted with restless emotions. He looked fearful... sad...\nand something else mixed in that made Blade's heart ache.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why not?\" Blade asked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm... I'm not feeling very well, but I'm fine.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir had never lied like that to Blade before. \"Akir...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Go, Blade,\" he commanded a bit forcefully. \"Don't forget\nyour satchel.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and picked up his satchel on his way out and\nopened the door. He wanted to stay with Akir. He wanted to be with his mate and\ntell him everything was okay. He couldn't even think of anything that could be\nwrong. Maybe Blade was just paranoid...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"></span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"></span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\nBut Akir wanted him to go, so he listened. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Before he could step outside, Akir called out his name.\nBlade turned around and saw Akir's face, and he swore he saw a tear glistening\ndown his cheek, but it must have been his imagination.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Akir?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled happily at him and said, \"I love you.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade pondered for a moment and replied, \"I love you too, Akir.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Take care, Blade\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The tarp closed behind him, but his thoughts were still\nreeling. For a moment, Blade paused and thought about what to do. Asha squeaked\nup at him, seeming to have noticed her father's frown. Blade booped her nose\nand picked up the wriggling hatchling and tucked her close to his chest,\nholding her as he took off into the skies. Whatever it was nagging at Akir,\nBlade would confront him about it later.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stepped through the streets of the market district,\nlooking around at all of the different stalls. Asha clung to his back, keeping\nquiet now that there were crowds of people around. She seemed to be very shy in\npublic, and that didn't help her much since a lot of people really enjoyed\nseeing hatchlings.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Even the two legs were very nice when Asha was around.\nHumans were especially happy to see her, calling her cute, adorable, beautiful,\nand just something they wanted to hug the life out of, which was very\nconcerning to Blade, who was being very protective of his daughter.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The ferals around were happy to greet Blade and congratulate\nhim on such a lovely hatchling, and Blade was more than content to take the\ncompliments. Neither he nor Akir ever received so much attention before Asha\nwas around.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">As Blade approached a stall filled with fruit, he saw what\nhe was looking for: starfruit. Asha happened to spot it too and started\nsqueaking excitedly. She nearly fell off of Blade's back as she wriggled and\ntried to get a better view.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Hey, settle down,\" Blade half-heartedly commanded. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The cart owner chuckled. He was a two-legged wolf dressed in\nwhite-linen robes with a shawl brought over his head. A bushy, gray tail puffed\nout of the back.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"She's very cute,\" he said. \"Does she enjoy fruit?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and set Asha on the ground so she couldn't claw\nand dismantle his feathers. \"She really loves starfruit.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The merchant reached for a bright-yellow fruit shaped like a\nstar and dropped down to a knee to hand it to Asha. She squeaked delightedly\nand took it from him, immediately burying her face into the fruit as she\nchomped down on it. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Thank you,\" Blade said with a toothy smile. He watched his\ndaughter viciously tear into the fruit, spraying juices all over her muzzle.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's my pleasure,\" the wolf said. \"But you two ought to\ntake shelter before the storm comes.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Storm?\" Blade asked and looked up at the sky. The majority\nof the sky was still a deep blue, but off over the eastern horizon were dark\nclouds rushing their way.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's supposed to be a bad one. Haven't had one like this in\nnearly two decades.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shuddered as memories flooded him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Anyway, would you like to purchase some fruit? I'm about to\npack up.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade tried to shake the memories away and nodded and picked\nout a variety of different fruits, and a few starfruits especially for Asha. He\npaid the wolf and shoved them into his satchel. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Thanks again,\" Blade said as he grabbed the now sticky Asha\nand plopped her onto his back. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Stay safe!\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade turned and left, wandering further down the street. He\nwanted to get something for Akir to hopefully brighten his day. His mate hasn't\nbeen in the greatest of moods, and Blade hoped that he could cheer him up.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">In addition to that, he would try to convince Akir to mate\nagain! They haven't had many chances now that they had a daughter, but they\ncould try to quietly do it while she slept in her crib. Or maybe Blade could\nlet her spend the night at Talia's... Even though he trusted Talia with his life,\nhe still wasn't sure if Asha would enjoy that.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrugged his wings and looked up at the sky. Dark clouds\nloomed high above him, growing closer as they carried the malevolent storm. He\nshuddered again. Rain was already rare enough, and storms were even rarer. He\nalready saw people closing up their shops and taking down their stalls,\npreparing for the impending weather.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade hurried along, determined to buy his mate something\nbefore the storm hit. Luckily, he found a jewelry shop that was still open. He\nstepped inside the building and looked around curiously at all of the golden\nmetal and shiny gems that were set on display. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Hey! Shoo! If you don't have any money, get out!\" a cross\nhuman growled from behind a counter. Blade's ears drooped as he realized that\nhe wasn't welcome here. He turned to leave, but he really wanted to get\nsomething for Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">So, he turned back around and glared at the shop owner. \"I\ndo have money.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The owner was a big, burly male with thick arms and a thick\nhead. Blade thought if the situation turned for the worst that he'd have a\ntough time defending against such a large man, and he also had to protect Asha.\nMaybe this wasn't such a good idea...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, you do? How does a beast come by enough money for\njewelry?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gulped and glanced away. \"I... I work at the docks.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The man let out a boisterous laugh and shook his head and\nwaved his hand. \"It doesn't matter as long as you're not stealin' from me. What\nare ya lookin' for?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade approached the counter. Asha was keeping quiet on his\nback, seeming to be unsure of what sound to make. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Something for my mate... Uhm... what would you suggest?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The man furrowed his brow and shrugged. \"I've never had a\nferal customer. What does she look like?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed a little and held back a chuckle. \"W-well... She\nhas blue and purple scales.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Hmm.\" He walked over to a section with a lot of gold hoops\nand bands, and some of them had jewels in them. Blade particularly liked the\nblue-gemmed ones and thought those would match perfectly with Akir, and the man\nseemed to think the same.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Does she wear earrings?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade remembered that Akir did used to wear a golden band\nthrough his left ear when he was younger... before it was ripped out and left a\ntear as a scar. He wondered if Akir would like another one or if it would just\nbring back painful memories.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Not anymore... but I think she may like a new one.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Just one?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and bared an awkward smile.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I suppose you ferals do have different tastes... How would\nshe like this one?\" he asked and withdrew a thick band that had sapphires\nmelded into the outer edge. Now that Blade thought about it, having gems in the\nearring would appear rather feminine. He didn't think Akir would really like\nthat. Blade was the more feminine one anyway!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Hmm... What about just a plain-gold one like that?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The man grumbled something, most likely a racial slur, and\nwithdrew a second earring that was made out of just gold. \"This one is eight\ngold pieces.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha squeaked on Blade's back and reached out for it. Blade\nchuckled and nuzzled her to tell her to keep quiet. He returned his attention\nto the merchant and nodded as he reached into his satchel and withdrew the\namount. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Here,\" he said, and they made the exchange. Blade admired\nthe golden band in his paw. It was shiny and smooth, and it had an empty space\nwhere an ear would fit to latch onto. Asha meeped and reached for it, so Blade\nlet her hold it as he walked out.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Thanks!\" he said and happily padded away. He took the ring\nfrom Asha, despite her squeak of disapproval, and slipped it into his satchel.\nHe gave his daughter a firm, loving nuzzle, feeling elated to have found his\nmate something. He hoped Akir would like it!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade held Asha in his arms again and took off into the\nskies, angling toward their home. He noticed that the storm was nearly upon\nthem, and the winds were buffeting him around, making flight rather difficult.\nHe clutched Asha tightly against his chest while she meeped and squeaked. Blade\nfelt extremely anxious to get home. He didn't want to be caught in the storm,\nespecially when he had his daughter with him. At least when he returned, Akir\nwould be there to calm the both of them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Thankfully, Blade saw their home before the storm could\nreach the city. The winds were getting stronger, but it wasn't anything he\ncouldn't handle. Akir had always said Blade was a good flier, but Blade just thought\nit was because of his feathers giving him an advantage.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But something didn't sit right in his stomach. When he\nlooked down, he saw an increasing number of ferals around their home. They all\ngathered around, peering around the front of their house. Blade wondered what\nthe commotion was about, and he quickly dived down.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He landed gently with Asha in his arms. She seemed to be\nupset about something, and she squirmed restlessly in his arms. Blade held her\ntightly with one paw, walking on the other three and making his way and bumping\ninto shoulders.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Darkness started to descend over them, and rain started to\nfall, dripping down from the skies and pattering against the sand and buildings\nand ferals around. The pleasant scent was strong in the air, but Blade caught a\nwhiff of something like a fresh kill. The smell of blood was stronger the\ncloser he got, and it made his heart pound heavily in his chest. He elicited a\nwhimper and quickly rushed forward. Asha squeaked with distress, but he could\nhardly hear her. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">All he could hear were his thoughts saying, \"No, no, no, no,\nno,\" over and over again. Every step he took was weaker than the last.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When Blade finally broke free from the crowd, his heart\nstopped.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir was lying dead right outside their door, his body\nbrutally rendered and bleeding. Gashes and bruises lined his blue and purple\nscales, and what looking to be a gaping hole was punched in his chest. A large\npool of blood formed beneath him and oozed around, trickling through the\ncrevices of stone and sand.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade couldn't bring himself to move. He stared in shock,\nseeing his mate's lifeless body. His heart shattered into a thousand pieces as\nhis soul drained from his body in the tears that poured down his cheeks. Memories\nof the time he spent with Akir flashed by and zoomed out of his mind before he\ncould grasp them and hold onto them. He desperately wanted to cling to each and\nevery one, not wanting to come back to the reality he now faced. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The love of his life, his better half, the mate of his\ndreams, was dead.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade didn't know what to feel... He couldn't believe it. He\nstood there, trembling and crying. Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes\nas he clenched his teeth and ground his claws into the dirt. His body was numb.\nUtterly numb.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha yelped and broke free from Blade's arms, running over\nto Akir before she collapsed and started running again. Blade clenched his\ntalons and teeth tightly, trying to force himself to move, but he wasn't strong\nenough. He closed his eyes tightly shut, unable to bear seeing Akir like that.\nStill, the tears seeped through and fell in an almost constant stream.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He stepped toward Akir's bloodied corpse, walking on legs\nthat could hardly carry his weight. They trembled and shook violently as he\nstrained to keep himself straight. He swayed back and forth, disoriented. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha squeaked and nosed at her other father as she gently\npushed him and pawed at him, trying to wake him up. His blood dirtied and\nmatted her feathers. Blade could hardly bare the sight. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade collapsed beside her, his golden feathers getting\nsoaked in blood as his front end lay on Akir's cold body. He wrapped himself around\nhis mate and buried his snout into his neck, crying profusely into it. He\nwhimpered and sniffled, hugging Akir's limp body tightly against him. He twined\nhis tail around Akir's limp tail, squeezing it lovingly as he sobbed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Pain wracked his body and seized his chest and throat. Blade\nfelt like he couldn't breathe. He gasped for breath and coughed, feeling like\nhe was dying too. With a futile attempt, he tried to shake Akir awake, calling\nout to him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He wanted to wake up from this nightmare. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Rain fell harder, and the crowd started to disperse, leaving\nBlade and his daughter alone while their tears and voices were drowned by the\nroaring storm. Darkness fell over them. Lightning flashed in the sky, giving\nout enough light for Blade to see Akir's blank face each time lightning struck.\n</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then it finally all hit Blade: the pain, the anguish, the\nsadness, the anger, and the regret. He ground his teeth together and clenched\nAkir's bloody scales tightly, never wanting to let go. He had hardly even\nnoticed his daughter still trying to wake her dead father up. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Akir... P-please... No... C-come back t-to me... please, my love...\"\nBlade moaned and whimpered before he started cursing at all of the gods, known\nand unknown. He despised them. He hated them for taking Akir away. If only he\nhad been here for his mate...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He felt cold&#8212;terribly cold. The pouring rain was relentless.\nFlashbacks of when he was younger coursed through his mind. He remembered being\non the brink of death, he remembered the numbness he felt, and he remembered\nAkir bringing him the warmth of life.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But he couldn't save Akir. He couldn't do anything. All that\nhe could feel was hopelessness... emptiness.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha whimpered beside Blade, trying to get his attention.\nBlade didn't hear her. It wasn't until he felt her trying to hide in his\nfeathers that he reached out and pulled her tightly against him. He nuzzled her\nand protected her from the rain with his wing. She was shivering. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He hated that she had to see this, but had she not been with\nhim, she would have met the same fate. Blade couldn't bear the thought of that.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade winced and cried all he could until he had no more\ntears to give. He didn't know what to do. He felt lost. Should he go to Talia?\nShould he seek vengeance? He couldn't just let whoever did this get away. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">No, he had to kill them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But Blade didn't know where to even start. He looked at his\nsoaked and trembling daughter, feeling the pain in his chest flare. He coughed\nand choked up. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Something twisted inside him. He clenched his jaw tightly\nand felt all of his emotions manifesting into a murderous resolve. It felt like\na thousand icy spikes were drilling into his body as he stood up and held his\ndaughter close to him. He looked back at the doorway as he stepped away. He forcefully\nthrew his satchel into their home, and then he took off.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade flew through the storm. He could hardly keep his wings\nfrom flaring open as the wind and rain tore at him. Asha squealed in distress,\nbut she kept still, trusting her father to make it through this, though Blade\nwasn't sure if he would.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled and pushed himself forward, straining all of\nhis muscles to keep from falling to his death. Vespera's home came into sight and\nhe landed with a heavy thud at the doorway with Asha tucked against his chest.\nHe knocked on the door harshly and set her down. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">With a somber look in his eyes, he kissed his daughter's\nforehead and nuzzled her one last time before taking off into the skies. He\nfelt a piece of his already broken heart snap off as she squeaked at him in\ndistress. Would this be the last time he ever saw her? How could he just leave\nher like this? </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He flew above her for a moment, making sure Vespera would\ntake her in. The dragoness looked confused as she glanced around, but she\npicked the dragonet up and quickly brought her inside. Asha would be safest in\nher mother's home.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade whirled around and sped back to their home. Rain\nwetted his feathers down, making them feel heavy as he was soaked in the frigid\nwater. He was already breathing hard as he returned. Again, hopelessness seeped\ninto him like the icy rain seeping into his hide.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's body was still there at the doorway. The rain washed\naway most of the blood, but it couldn't cleanse the ground of the crimson\nstains. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade whimpered and dragged Akir's body into their home. The\ntarp to their doorway was missing, so the rain splattered at the doorway and\ndripped into their hovel. As soon as Akir's body was away from the door, Blade\ncollapsed on him, crying and drowning in his sorrow again.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It felt like Blade cried for eternity. He wanted to cry\nmore, but no more tears would come out. His sadness was slowly being consumed\nby a festering anger inside of him. It boiled his blood to the point that he\nwas shaking. Blade clenched his paws together and struggled to stand. He looked\nover Akir's body, inspecting it for any clues to his killers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He found many bruises from either punches or kicks. There\nwere many clean cuts and gouges in his hide from swords or other sharp objects.\nNo claws. Then the gaping hole in his chest meant only one thing: Akir had been\nshot.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A vicious snarl formed at Blade's lips. <i>Humans.</i> But who and why?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled and swiped at the nearest breakable thing:\nAsha's crib. It shattered into hundreds of wooden pieces. He stamped his paws\nand found the next breakable thing: a chair for Talia. He attacked every\npossible wooden object until they were all shattered into thousands of pieces littering\nthe stone floor. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He clutched his chest and started to cough. It hurt... He hurt...So\nmuch pain. Blade cried out a somber wail and toppled to the side. The pain was\ntoo much&#8212;he'd never felt this much pain before. Blade roared and thrashed,\ntrying to expel the building anguish and agony that manifested inside him like\na demon seizing his soul, but he couldn't fight it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Rage consumed him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then Blade charged out of the house and took to the stormy\nskies. He flew straight toward the palace district with an insatiable fire\nburning in his heart. His mind was empty except for the desire to kill&#8212;a bloodlust.\nHe couldn't think straight nor could he really think at all. He was lost in\nreckless abandon, intent on killing every last human until he avenged Akir's\ndeath. But, his primary goal was their leader. If he killed their leader, then\nthat would be enough.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Hardly anyone was outside. Everyone was taking shelter from\nthe storm as it raged on, pouring nearly horizontal sheets of rain over the\ncity. The gusts of wind ripped Blade's wings back several times, almost throwing\nhim off balance. Lightning struck nearby, cracking and thundering loud enough\nthat Blade's ears rang for a moment. He didn't regard a single inkling of\nthought for his own safety and continued on.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Whatever happened to him tonight was in the hands of fate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's first victim was a lone guard donned in heavy plate\nmetal. He carried around a light, seeming to be searching for anyone caught in\nthe storm.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade descended on him and smashed the human's body into the\nground. He pulled off the man's helmet and then relentlessly slashed across his\nface as painful screams escaped his mouth all until Blade jabbed his claws into\nhis throat.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">With a roar, Blade claimed his first kill, and then the\nthunder echoed back. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A door opened to a house directly next to him. A woman\nstared at him in horror with her hand over her mouth. Blade growled at her and\nthought about killing her too, but she was innocent. He wouldn't kill the\ndefenseless.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He moved swiftly through the streets of the palace district,\nhunting for the next unlucky human to cross his path. He happened upon another\nguard, but this one had seen him first. He bared his sword and shield, putting\nup a fight.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But Blade smashed his shoulder into the shield before the\nguard could even raise his sword. The man staggered back, and Blade ripped the\nshield away with a crack, breaking the man's arm before he lunged and bit into\nhis exposed neck. Sharp teeth clamped down on the human's flesh, tearing into\nit as blood filled his maw. Blade jerked his head and ended the guard's life.\nHe spit the bile out and growled viciously before continuing on again.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It felt good to kill.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Between two giant pillars was one of the entrances into the\nmain palace. Blade felt small when he looked up at the towering colonnade, but\nhe didn't let that intimidate him. He was sure that this was where he would\nfind Akir's killers, even though he truly had no idea who they were. Usually it\nwas heavily guarded around the palace grounds, but Blade only saw two guards.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The guards rushed forward with pikes from the colonnade,\nshouting at him to stop. Blade ignored them, so they attacked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade jumped back to avoid one of the spears, but the other\ncaught his flank. He growled and quickly grabbed the spear that had jabbed him\nand ripped it away from the man, causing the guard to stumble forward into his\nlethally placed swipe. Blade caught the human's armored head and smashed it\ninto the ground.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The other guard used this opportunity to attack Blade again,\nbut he deflected the strike just in time and jumped back. Another attack jabbed\nat him, and Blade caught the wood between his teeth and bit down, breaking the\nsharp end off. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The screech of dagger rang out, and the guard bravely\ncharged Blade. Blade side-stepped and avoided the attack completely as the\nguard lost his footing on the slick cobblestones, falling flatly onto his face.\nBlade didn't waste a moment and mercilessly killed the guard.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A groan escaped the first guard's lips, and Blade ended his\nlife too. He wiped his bloody paws on the wet ground and winced as pain shot\nthrough his side. Warm blood seeped through his feathers as Blade clutched his\nwound. He growled and pushed through the pain, stepping up to two tall and wide\ndoors. He wondered where the rest of the palace's guards were, and he figured\nthey would all be inside.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm going to die here,\" he muttered and pushed the door\nopen.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Inside the vestibule, the floors were made of polished white\nand black marble. A short hallway connected to a long corridor running\nhorizontally with drapes and banners hanging from the walls. Everything looked\nso elegant that Blade couldn't fathom how much money went to building this one\nbuilding.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Surprisingly, it was very quiet and there weren't any guards\nnearby. Was the security always so loose?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Claws clacked on the marble as Blade took a right down the\ncorridor. He checked the first door and it opened up to an empty room. He shut\nit and continued on, checking each and every door and finding absolutely no\none. There were so many rooms and doors that he wasn't sure where the ruler of\nthe city would be. He had no idea what that human even looked like, but he\nfigured he should have at least found some nobles&#8212;or even just some servants.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The rain pattered against glass windows to a courtyard, and\nthe lightning flashed continuously. Thunder nearly shook the giant building,\nrattling the glass panes. Blade heard a soft plop and looked down, noticing a\ndroplet of his blood staining the floor. He grimaced.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Armor clanked behind him, and a guard quickly approached. \"What\nare you doing here!? Stop where you are!\" He withdrew a sword and angled it at\nthe dragon.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled and turned around, his tail flicking behind him\nas he crouched down, teeth bared.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You're under arrest for trespassing on palace grounds,\nbeast. Stand down and come quietly.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade was surprised that the guard didn't immediately attack him, but that didn't\nmatter. He would end the wretch's life.\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He stepped toward the guard threateningly, ready to tear him\napart. Not a single ounce of fear shown in the human's eyes. He stood his\nground against the larger dragon, watching and following him with a sword. This\nobviously wasn't his first fight with a feral dragon.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I warned you, dragon.\" The man raised his sword and swung\nat Blade. Blade ducked beneath it, nearly getting his head lopped off. Then he\nlunged and clawed at armor, his claws harmlessly scraping it. He knocked the\nman back with his strike, giving him enough room to pounce and take the human\nto the ground, but not before his sword sliced across Blade's vulnerable belly.\n</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade roared and snapped at the man's head, but he caught an\narm instead. He felt his teeth sink into the armor and his flesh as the man\ncried out in pain. He twisted his head and tore into the limb, but he had to\nrelease it quickly to avoid being stabbed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He retreated back a step, breathing raggedly between his\nteeth. More blood dripped onto the ground while pain made his muscles tense up.\nHis mouth was filled with the warm, metallic taste of fresh blood.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The guard climbed to his feet, his left arm hanging limply\nat his side with blood oozing down it. With his sword in the other hand, he\npointed it at Blade and then gave a yell as he charged forward. Blade again\nbarely dodged his strike, but took the opportunity to rush and knock the wind\nout of the human with his shoulder.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade followed his initial attack with his claws to the\nhuman's neck. He missed and luckily got hit with the broad side of the sword\nagainst the side of his muzzle instead of the blade. Tears brimmed in his eyes\nas his vision swirled. He stumbled to the side and had to jump backward to\navoid another attack.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled viciously and hissed with irritation. He'd\nnever met a human so skilled in fighting before. Their fight had taken too\nlong, and now there were another two guards rushing at him from behind, having\nheard the commotion. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade whirled around and dodged both of their attacks, and\nthen he had to jump away again as the first guard attacked from behind. His sharp\nsword caught his tail, sending more pain through Blade. He now faced three\nguards, and one of them had a pike.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The wounded guard retreated behind the other two, clutching\nhis bleeding arm with his sword arm. The right guard attacked Blade head on,\nand the guard with the pike followed the attack with his own. Blade dodged the\nsword and tapped the pike away just before dodging the sword again. He hissed\nas the spear head grazed his neck on its second stab.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stamped his forepaw down as he caught the handle and\nbroke the spear against the ground. He spun around and used his tail to catch\nthe other man off guard, thwacking him painfully hard in the hip, knocking him\nto the side. Blade surged forward in his opening and pounced on the wounded\nguard behind the other two. He caught him by surprise and killed him with a\nbite to the neck before he could defend himself.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Captain!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade swiftly jumped away and crouched low again. He was\nbreathing hard and bleeding from several places, but his golden eyes were lit\nwith ferocity. A snarl formed at his lips as he elicited another feral growl. He\nstood his ground and waited for the next attack.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The guards were shouting and calling for reinforcements,\ngiving Blade little to no time. He quickly rushed them, forcing their attacks.\nThe guard raised his sword high, and as soon as he did Blade tackled him to the\nground. The sword caught one of his horns when it came down, rattling Blade's\nskull, but it didn't harm him otherwise. He swiped the polearm away with his\ntail, blocking the attack as he killed the other guard. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">With bloodied claws, Blade swiveled around and viciously\nswiped at the other guard repeatedly, forcing him on the defensive until he\nbroke his guard and killed him too.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade hobbled away as quickly as he could, panting and\ntrying to regain his focus. He was already exhausted and his vision felt weaker\nand weaker the longer he continued. A trail of blood followed behind him as he\nlimped through the corridor. His legs trembled beneath him, but he still had\nfight left in him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He didn't have time to check every door anymore. Instead, he\nsearched for a throne room or whatever the biggest and fanciest room was. He\ntruly had no idea where to even look... but he was determined.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Before turning a corner, Blade poked his head around and saw\nat least eight guards standing with halberds at their sides, lined up against\ntwo walls leading toward a large door. It looked like a lobby of sorts before a\nthrone room. If he was going to do this, he had to do it quick.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade roared and charged in, immediately ramming the first\nguard into the wall with full force, crushing his armor and banging his head\nharshly into the stone. He fell, and Blade was rushing toward the next person.\nHe sliced his throat open with his talons and pounced on the next guard before\nhe could attack.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">One by one, each of the guards fell. They were too spread\nout, giving Blade just enough time to kill them before the next one came. As\nthe last guard's body hit the ground, Blade watched the large door creak open,\nand another column of guards rushed in. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Kill it!\" someone shouted. \"I want his head!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled and pinned his ears back. He wanted to fight\nthem, and he wanted to rip them all apart... but he knew he would die before he\nwould even make a dent. There were too many.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But Akir... he desperately wanted to avenge his fallen mate.\nHe needed to get past these guards to get to the leader, but Blade didn't want\nto die. Not yet...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade turned around and sprinted the way he came. He heard\nthe guards shouting and chasing him with their rattling armor following behind.\nBlade nearly slipped and fell as he scrambled away, his paws soaked with blood.\nThe marble floors didn't give anything for his claws to grasp.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He slid around the corner and found himself face to face\nwith four more guards inspecting the slain bodies he had just killed. Blade\nwatched as one of the guards drew a strange looking object with a hole in the\nend, and then he realized just too late what it was.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><i>CRACK!</i></span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A burst of pain wracked Blade's right shoulder just where\nhis neck met his body. He yelped and stumbled backward before shaking it off\nand running as fast as he could away. Hot blood poured from his wound as he\nstrained his torn muscle. He could hardly run straight, and his body was\nfeeling weaker by the second. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had no idea where he was, and he kept running into\nmore and more guards. They seemed to be on full alert now. By the time he\nfinally found an exit, it was blocked off by several guards.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The guards chasing him were rapidly closing in. He reached a\ndead end with nowhere to go... This was it. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade was going to die.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade backed up until his tail brushed against the wall. He\nwas trapped in another hallway, with guards rapidly closing in on him from both\nsides. He looked between both of the groups verging on him and felt his emotions\ncatching up with him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He was scared; he didn't want to die. His vengeance had\nfailed, and he didn't even come close. All of his efforts had been futile, and\nhe was about to meet the end of it all. <i>What\ncomes after death?</i></span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Akir... I'm so sorry,\" Blade said beneath his heavy breaths,\nstarting to cry. He'd never see his mate again, or his daughter, or even Talia.\nOne guard raised a gun and pointed it directly at Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade lowered his head and accepted his defeat&#8212;his end. More\nand more memories flooded his fading vision, bringing a small smile to his\nlips. Maybe he would see Akir in the afterlife... </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The loud crack of the gun sounded and rang in Blade's ears,\nbut he quickly realized that he hadn't been shot. Miraculously, he was alive. He\nwondered how and why, but he knew he wouldn't live for much longer anyway.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade quickly looked behind him and noticed the glass to a\nwindow had been completely shattered. <i>Why\nhadn't I thought of that?</i></span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He took advantage of the guard's missed shot and leapt\nthrough the window into the courtyard. Rain still poured from the sky, pelting\nBlade's blood-soaked feathers, and lightning crackled through the darkness.\nAnother gunshot sounded behind him, and he heard the bullet whizz by and strike\nthe ground near him. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Was fate giving him a second chance?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">An open sky was all Blade needed. He jumped into the air on\ntrembling legs and barely had enough strength to climb up, but he managed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then as he cleared the walls, a sudden burst of wind carried\nhim away, knocking him off balance and sending him flying backward. Blade\nhissed and twisted around quickly before he crashed into the roof. With the\nwind pushing him forward, he used it to glide and find his way around. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then he remembered that the palace was protected by a\nmagical barrier and felt apprehensive to continue forward, but he couldn't stop\nhimself. He winced expectantly, but before he knew it, he was outside the\npalace district, unscathed by any magic. But Blade didn't know how much longer\nhe could fly. He was already pushing past his limits, and it was thanks to the\npowerful wind that he was even still in the air.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Luckily for him, he flew over the district Talia lived in.\nAs long as he wouldn't get struck by lightning, all he had to do was glide\ndown.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">And Blade landed soon after. His head darted back and forth,\nsearching for Talia's street. He could hardly see straight as blood from an\nunknown wound dripped into his eyes. Blade hobbled and limped around until he\nrecognized some of the area. He found Talia's house soon after and struggled to\npull himself there.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">By now, he was weak, freezing, and nearly about to die. He\nknocked on Talia's door weakly, hardly able to even raise his good arm. He\nwaited... and waited... but she didn't answer. He tried the door latch, but it was\nlocked. Blade groaned in pain and banged his head against the door. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He heard the latch come undone and the door flung open.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh my God...\" Talia immediately stepped aside to let Blade\ninside and locked the door behind them. She wrapped her arms around his belly\nand helped drag him inside, but she had grabbed one of his cuts and caused him\na lot of pain.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade tried to keep standing, but he fell and cried out in\npain. A series of questions spouted from Talia's mouth, but he couldn't even\nanswer one of them. His head was spinning and his ears were ringing. Could he\neven hear her?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You're not going to die, Blade,\" she reassured. \"I'm going\nto keep you alive. Stay with me... Don't fall asleep.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded meekly, but he could already feel himself\nstarting to slip away. Even in Talia's warm home he felt like icicles were\npricking his hide, and in some places it felt like they were stabbing him. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's... It's c-cold...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Stay with me, Blade!\" she shouted and tapped his muzzle\nfirmly. She was rushing around and grabbing her supplies. Blade winced and\nhissed as she pressed a cloth to his side against his gaping wound. It stung\nterribly, but his numbness saved him from some of the pain. He remembered the\nfirst time he had ever met Talia, and it was a situation pretty similar to\nthis.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Except, Blade wasn't sure if she could save him this time.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then more and more areas were stinging, making his ragged, blood-soaked\nfeathers puff out and his body tremble. He shut his eyes tight and moaned\npainfully. It was growing increasingly harder to stay awake. After a while, his\nbody felt completely and utterly numb. He wasn't even sure if he was breathing\nanymore.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia tended to him, constantly saying things that Blade\ncouldn't hear or understand, but it reassured him to know that she was trying\nto comfort him. She had him flip onto his other side, and that was the last\nthing Blade did. His head suddenly felt extremely dizzy and light. He tried to\nkeep his eyes open... He tried to stay awake... But he couldn't fight anymore. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It was over. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n</span>\n </body>\n</html>\n"

    "content": "THE RAGING STORM\n\nBlade woke up with Asha curled in his arms, sleeping soundly. The cute,\nblack-feathered hatchling was making meeping sounds while she slept, and she had\na dragon tucked against her body too. The toy plushy was nestled in her embrace\nas she squeezed around it. That made Blade smile giddily as he held her just a\nlittle closer.\n\nAkir wasn't with them and must have woken up to go somewhere. Ever since Asha\nhad hatched, he had been acting much more adult-like. He didn't laze around as\nmuch as he used to, and he seemed to be constantly worrying about something,\nwhich, in turn, made Blade worried.\n\nBut whenever Blade would ask Akir about it, Akir would just shrug it off and say\nit was nothing.\n\nBlade knew something was wrong, but Akir would only get angry if he pressed him\nfor more information. Blade wished that his mate would talk to him, but Akir\nstill seemed as happy as ever, especially when he was around Asha.\n\nIt warmed Blade's heart to see that proud smile that would often curl Akir's\nlips. He, too, felt very proud and joyful to have his adorable hatchling in his\narms. She was everything he had dreamed of, and he couldn't wait to see her grow\nup. He hoped that she would grow into a beautiful dragoness, but not too\nbeautiful that she would have males constantly hounding after her.\n\nWith her being just a month or two old, Blade didn't have to be concerned about\nthat yet!\n\nAsha made a small, squeaking sound and yawned, baring her very tiny but sharp\nteeth. Then she looked up at her father, who had a huge smile across his muzzle.\n\n\"Good morning, sweetie,\" Blade said and affectionately licked her nose.\n\nAsha squeaked back as her feathers puffed out, making Blade giggle. He nuzzled\nher and held her tight in his arms. She wiggled and meeped before yawning widely\nagain. Blade had to let her go before she wrenched herself out of his grasp.\n\nAsha stretched out on the bed, baring her tiny claws and flicking her cute,\nlengthy tail. Blade grinned and hopped off of the bed, stretching out too and\nmaking a ramp for her to climb down from. She wasn't so small that she'd hurt\nherself jumping off, but he liked making it safer for her anyway.\n\nShe made another cute squeaking sound and climbed down Blade's back. Blade\nwinced as one of her sharp claws pricked his hide, but he grinned as she climbed\nonto his head and laid there between his horns. He looked up at her, seeing her\nsmiling face looking down at him with her head cocked to the side.\n\n\"So, it's one of those days again?\" Blade said and chuckled. \"Okay, but don't\nfall off this time!\"\n\nAsha squeaked her affirmative answer and held tightly to her father, her limbs\nwrapping around his head. Blade stepped out into the living room and saw Akir\nlying on the furs, looking to be deep in thought about something. His brow was\nfurrowed and his tail was swishing back and forth.\n\n\"Morning, Akir,\" Blade said.\n\nAsha peeped and wriggled furiously at seeing her other father. Akir turned his\nhead, and his stressful expression immediately vanished and was replaced by a\nwarm smile.\n\n\"Good morning, cuties,\" he said. \"I see that Asha is feeling rowdy again today.\"\n\nBlade half-nodded, trying not to shake his daughter off of his head. His neck\nslightly ached from holding her there, making him realize that she was getting\nbigger. \"I'll be sad when she's too big for this.\"\n\nAkir chuckled. \"Sadly, it won't be too long at the rate she is growing. Still,\nit's really cute!\"\n\nBlade smiled toothily and sat sejant next to his mate with their hatchling\nsqueaking excitedly on top of him, clinging to her father's head tightly.\n\n\"What were you thinking about?\" Blade asked and squeezed Akir's paw lovingly.\n\nAkir's face shifted unpleasantly. \"Nothing you need to worry about... Hey, why\ndon't you go get some food for us today at the market? Take Asha with you.\"\n\nBlade noticed something stirring in Akir's expression. His talons twitched and\nhis tail was still swishing behind him, sliding across the stone floor.\nSomething was pressing at Akir's mind, but Blade couldn't figure out what it\nwas. More than anything, Akir looked nervous. Blade had never seen Akir act\nnervous before...\n\n\"What's wrong, Akir?\"\n\nAkir shook his head as if to rid himself of his thoughts. \"I said it was\nnothing. We could use some fruit, if you wouldn't mind. Asha likes the starfruit\nbest.\" He changed the subject immediately, directing Blade away from the\nproblem—a common tactic for him.\n\nBlade peered at Akir and then looked up at Asha who seemed to recognize the name\nof her favorite fruit because she gave a loud meep. \"You're not coming along?\"\nBlade asked worriedly.\n\n\"No. Not this time, Blade. You'll be fine. Just make sure you keep Asha close to\nyou at all times.\"\n\nBlade's eyes met Akir's, and he saw something in those deep-blue orbs that\nswirled and twisted with restless emotions. He looked fearful... sad... and\nsomething else mixed in that made Blade's heart ache.\n\n\"Why not?\" Blade asked.\n\n\"I'm... I'm not feeling very well, but I'm fine.\"\n\nAkir had never lied like that to Blade before. \"Akir...\"\n\n\"Go, Blade,\" he commanded a bit forcefully. \"Don't forget your satchel.\"\n\nBlade sighed and picked up his satchel on his way out and opened the door. He\nwanted to stay with Akir. He wanted to be with his mate and tell him everything\nwas okay. He couldn't even think of anything that could be wrong. Maybe Blade\nwas just paranoid...\n\nBut Akir wanted him to go, so he listened.\n\nBefore he could step outside, Akir called out his name. Blade turned around and\nsaw Akir's face, and he swore he saw a tear glistening down his cheek, but it\nmust have been his imagination.\n\n\"Akir?\"\n\nAkir smiled happily at him and said, \"I love you.\"\n\nBlade pondered for a moment and replied, \"I love you too, Akir.\"\n\n\"Take care, Blade\"\n\nThe tarp closed behind him, but his thoughts were still reeling. For a moment,\nBlade paused and thought about what to do. Asha squeaked up at him, seeming to\nhave noticed her father's frown. Blade booped her nose and picked up the\nwriggling hatchling and tucked her close to his chest, holding her as he took\noff into the skies. Whatever it was nagging at Akir, Blade would confront him\nabout it later.\n\nBlade stepped through the streets of the market district, looking around at all\nof the different stalls. Asha clung to his back, keeping quiet now that there\nwere crowds of people around. She seemed to be very shy in public, and that\ndidn't help her much since a lot of people really enjoyed seeing hatchlings.\n\nEven the two legs were very nice when Asha was around. Humans were especially\nhappy to see her, calling her cute, adorable, beautiful, and just something they\nwanted to hug the life out of, which was very concerning to Blade, who was being\nvery protective of his daughter.\n\nThe ferals around were happy to greet Blade and congratulate him on such a\nlovely hatchling, and Blade was more than content to take the compliments.\nNeither he nor Akir ever received so much attention before Asha was around.\n\nAs Blade approached a stall filled with fruit, he saw what he was looking for:\nstarfruit. Asha happened to spot it too and started squeaking excitedly. She\nnearly fell off of Blade's back as she wriggled and tried to get a better view.\n\n\"Hey, settle down,\" Blade half-heartedly commanded.\n\nThe cart owner chuckled. He was a two-legged wolf dressed in white-linen robes\nwith a shawl brought over his head. A bushy, gray tail puffed out of the back.\n\n\"She's very cute,\" he said. \"Does she enjoy fruit?\"\n\nBlade nodded and set Asha on the ground so she couldn't claw and dismantle his\nfeathers. \"She really loves starfruit.\"\n\nThe merchant reached for a bright-yellow fruit shaped like a star and dropped\ndown to a knee to hand it to Asha. She squeaked delightedly and took it from\nhim, immediately burying her face into the fruit as she chomped down on it.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Blade said with a toothy smile. He watched his daughter viciously\ntear into the fruit, spraying juices all over her muzzle.\n\n\"It's my pleasure,\" the wolf said. \"But you two ought to take shelter before the\nstorm comes.\"\n\n\"Storm?\" Blade asked and looked up at the sky. The majority of the sky was still\na deep blue, but off over the eastern horizon were dark clouds rushing their\nway.\n\n\"It's supposed to be a bad one. Haven't had one like this in nearly two\ndecades.\"\n\nBlade shuddered as memories flooded him.\n\n\"Anyway, would you like to purchase some fruit? I'm about to pack up.\"\n\nBlade tried to shake the memories away and nodded and picked out a variety of\ndifferent fruits, and a few starfruits especially for Asha. He paid the wolf and\nshoved them into his satchel.\n\n\"Thanks again,\" Blade said as he grabbed the now sticky Asha and plopped her\nonto his back.\n\n\"Stay safe!\"\n\nBlade turned and left, wandering further down the street. He wanted to get\nsomething for Akir to hopefully brighten his day. His mate hasn't been in the\ngreatest of moods, and Blade hoped that he could cheer him up.\n\nIn addition to that, he would try to convince Akir to mate again! They haven't\nhad many chances now that they had a daughter, but they could try to quietly do\nit while she slept in her crib. Or maybe Blade could let her spend the night at\nTalia's... Even though he trusted Talia with his life, he still wasn't sure if\nAsha would enjoy that.\n\nBlade shrugged his wings and looked up at the sky. Dark clouds loomed high above\nhim, growing closer as they carried the malevolent storm. He shuddered again.\nRain was already rare enough, and storms were even rarer. He already saw people\nclosing up their shops and taking down their stalls, preparing for the impending\nweather.\n\nBlade hurried along, determined to buy his mate something before the storm hit.\nLuckily, he found a jewelry shop that was still open. He stepped inside the\nbuilding and looked around curiously at all of the golden metal and shiny gems\nthat were set on display.\n\n\"Hey! Shoo! If you don't have any money, get out!\" a cross human growled from\nbehind a counter. Blade's ears drooped as he realized that he wasn't welcome\nhere. He turned to leave, but he really wanted to get something for Akir.\n\nSo, he turned back around and glared at the shop owner. \"I do have money.\"\n\nThe owner was a big, burly male with thick arms and a thick head. Blade thought\nif the situation turned for the worst that he'd have a tough time defending\nagainst such a large man, and he also had to protect Asha. Maybe this wasn't\nsuch a good idea...\n\n\"Oh, you do? How does a beast come by enough money for jewelry?\"\n\nBlade gulped and glanced away. \"I... I work at the docks.\"\n\nThe man let out a boisterous laugh and shook his head and waved his hand. \"It\ndoesn't matter as long as you're not stealin' from me. What are ya lookin' for?\"\n\nBlade approached the counter. Asha was keeping quiet on his back, seeming to be\nunsure of what sound to make.\n\n\"Something for my mate... Uhm... what would you suggest?\"\n\nThe man furrowed his brow and shrugged. \"I've never had a feral customer. What\ndoes she look like?\"\n\nBlade blushed a little and held back a chuckle. \"W-well... She has blue and\npurple scales.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" He walked over to a section with a lot of gold hoops and bands, and some\nof them had jewels in them. Blade particularly liked the blue-gemmed ones and\nthought those would match perfectly with Akir, and the man seemed to think the\nsame.\n\n\"Does she wear earrings?\"\n\nBlade remembered that Akir did used to wear a golden band through his left ear\nwhen he was younger... before it was ripped out and left a tear as a scar. He\nwondered if Akir would like another one or if it would just bring back painful\nmemories.\n\n\"Not anymore... but I think she may like a new one.\"\n\n\"Just one?\"\n\nBlade nodded and bared an awkward smile.\n\n\"I suppose you ferals do have different tastes... How would she like this one?\"\nhe asked and withdrew a thick band that had sapphires melded into the outer\nedge. Now that Blade thought about it, having gems in the earring would appear\nrather feminine. He didn't think Akir would really like that. Blade was the more\nfeminine one anyway!\n\n\"Hmm... What about just a plain-gold one like that?\"\n\nThe man grumbled something, most likely a racial slur, and withdrew a second\nearring that was made out of just gold. \"This one is eight gold pieces.\"\n\nAsha squeaked on Blade's back and reached out for it. Blade chuckled and nuzzled\nher to tell her to keep quiet. He returned his attention to the merchant and\nnodded as he reached into his satchel and withdrew the amount.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, and they made the exchange. Blade admired the golden band in\nhis paw. It was shiny and smooth, and it had an empty space where an ear would\nfit to latch onto. Asha meeped and reached for it, so Blade let her hold it as\nhe walked out.\n\n\"Thanks!\" he said and happily padded away. He took the ring from Asha, despite\nher squeak of disapproval, and slipped it into his satchel. He gave his daughter\na firm, loving nuzzle, feeling elated to have found his mate something. He hoped\nAkir would like it!\n\nBlade held Asha in his arms again and took off into the skies, angling toward\ntheir home. He noticed that the storm was nearly upon them, and the winds were\nbuffeting him around, making flight rather difficult. He clutched Asha tightly\nagainst his chest while she meeped and squeaked. Blade felt extremely anxious to\nget home. He didn't want to be caught in the storm, especially when he had his\ndaughter with him. At least when he returned, Akir would be there to calm the\nboth of them.\n\nThankfully, Blade saw their home before the storm could reach the city. The\nwinds were getting stronger, but it wasn't anything he couldn't handle. Akir had\nalways said Blade was a good flier, but Blade just thought it was because of his\nfeathers giving him an advantage.\n\nBut something didn't sit right in his stomach. When he looked down, he saw an\nincreasing number of ferals around their home. They all gathered around, peering\naround the front of their house. Blade wondered what the commotion was about,\nand he quickly dived down.\n\nHe landed gently with Asha in his arms. She seemed to be upset about something,\nand she squirmed restlessly in his arms. Blade held her tightly with one paw,\nwalking on the other three and making his way and bumping into shoulders.\n\nDarkness started to descend over them, and rain started to fall, dripping down\nfrom the skies and pattering against the sand and buildings and ferals around.\nThe pleasant scent was strong in the air, but Blade caught a whiff of something\nlike a fresh kill. The smell of blood was stronger the closer he got, and it\nmade his heart pound heavily in his chest. He elicited a whimper and quickly\nrushed forward. Asha squeaked with distress, but he could hardly hear her.\n\nAll he could hear were his thoughts saying, \"No, no, no, no, no,\" over and over\nagain. Every step he took was weaker than the last.\n\nWhen Blade finally broke free from the crowd, his heart stopped.\n\nAkir was lying dead right outside their door, his body brutally rendered and\nbleeding. Gashes and bruises lined his blue and purple scales, and what looking\nto be a gaping hole was punched in his chest. A large pool of blood formed\nbeneath him and oozed around, trickling through the crevices of stone and sand.\n\nBlade couldn't bring himself to move. He stared in shock, seeing his mate's\nlifeless body. His heart shattered into a thousand pieces as his soul drained\nfrom his body in the tears that poured down his cheeks. Memories of the time he\nspent with Akir flashed by and zoomed out of his mind before he could grasp them\nand hold onto them. He desperately wanted to cling to each and every one, not\nwanting to come back to the reality he now faced.\n\nThe love of his life, his better half, the mate of his dreams, was dead.\n\nBlade didn't know what to feel... He couldn't believe it. He stood there,\ntrembling and crying. Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes as he clenched\nhis teeth and ground his claws into the dirt. His body was numb. Utterly numb.\n\nAsha yelped and broke free from Blade's arms, running over to Akir before she\ncollapsed and started running again. Blade clenched his talons and teeth\ntightly, trying to force himself to move, but he wasn't strong enough. He closed\nhis eyes tightly shut, unable to bear seeing Akir like that. Still, the tears\nseeped through and fell in an almost constant stream.\n\nHe stepped toward Akir's bloodied corpse, walking on legs that could hardly\ncarry his weight. They trembled and shook violently as he strained to keep\nhimself straight. He swayed back and forth, disoriented.\n\nAsha squeaked and nosed at her other father as she gently pushed him and pawed\nat him, trying to wake him up. His blood dirtied and matted her feathers. Blade\ncould hardly bare the sight.\n\nBlade collapsed beside her, his golden feathers getting soaked in blood as his\nfront end lay on Akir's cold body. He wrapped himself around his mate and buried\nhis snout into his neck, crying profusely into it. He whimpered and sniffled,\nhugging Akir's limp body tightly against him. He twined his tail around Akir's\nlimp tail, squeezing it lovingly as he sobbed.\n\nPain wracked his body and seized his chest and throat. Blade felt like he\ncouldn't breathe. He gasped for breath and coughed, feeling like he was dying\ntoo. With a futile attempt, he tried to shake Akir awake, calling out to him.\n\nHe wanted to wake up from this nightmare.\n\nRain fell harder, and the crowd started to disperse, leaving Blade and his\ndaughter alone while their tears and voices were drowned by the roaring storm.\nDarkness fell over them. Lightning flashed in the sky, giving out enough light\nfor Blade to see Akir's blank face each time lightning struck.\n\nThen it finally all hit Blade: the pain, the anguish, the sadness, the anger,\nand the regret. He ground his teeth together and clenched Akir's bloody scales\ntightly, never wanting to let go. He had hardly even noticed his daughter still\ntrying to wake her dead father up.\n\n\"Akir... P-please... No... C-come back t-to me... please, my love...\" Blade\nmoaned and whimpered before he started cursing at all of the gods, known and\nunknown. He despised them. He hated them for taking Akir away. If only he had\nbeen here for his mate...\n\nHe felt cold—terribly cold. The pouring rain was relentless. Flashbacks of when\nhe was younger coursed through his mind. He remembered being on the brink of\ndeath, he remembered the numbness he felt, and he remembered Akir bringing him\nthe warmth of life.\n\nBut he couldn't save Akir. He couldn't do anything. All that he could feel was\nhopelessness... emptiness.\n\nAsha whimpered beside Blade, trying to get his attention. Blade didn't hear her.\nIt wasn't until he felt her trying to hide in his feathers that he reached out\nand pulled her tightly against him. He nuzzled her and protected her from the\nrain with his wing. She was shivering.\n\nHe hated that she had to see this, but had she not been with him, she would have\nmet the same fate. Blade couldn't bear the thought of that.\n\nBlade winced and cried all he could until he had no more tears to give. He\ndidn't know what to do. He felt lost. Should he go to Talia? Should he seek\nvengeance? He couldn't just let whoever did this get away.\n\nNo, he had to kill them.\n\nBut Blade didn't know where to even start. He looked at his soaked and trembling\ndaughter, feeling the pain in his chest flare. He coughed and choked up.\n\nSomething twisted inside him. He clenched his jaw tightly and felt all of his\nemotions manifesting into a murderous resolve. It felt like a thousand icy\nspikes were drilling into his body as he stood up and held his daughter close to\nhim. He looked back at the doorway as he stepped away. He forcefully threw his\nsatchel into their home, and then he took off.\n\nBlade flew through the storm. He could hardly keep his wings from flaring open\nas the wind and rain tore at him. Asha squealed in distress, but she kept still,\ntrusting her father to make it through this, though Blade wasn't sure if he\nwould.\n\nBlade growled and pushed himself forward, straining all of his muscles to keep\nfrom falling to his death. Vespera's home came into sight and he landed with a\nheavy thud at the doorway with Asha tucked against his chest. He knocked on the\ndoor harshly and set her down.\n\nWith a somber look in his eyes, he kissed his daughter's forehead and nuzzled\nher one last time before taking off into the skies. He felt a piece of his\nalready broken heart snap off as she squeaked at him in distress. Would this be\nthe last time he ever saw her? How could he just leave her like this?\n\nHe flew above her for a moment, making sure Vespera would take her in. The\ndragoness looked confused as she glanced around, but she picked the dragonet up\nand quickly brought her inside. Asha would be safest in her mother's home.\n\nBlade whirled around and sped back to their home. Rain wetted his feathers down,\nmaking them feel heavy as he was soaked in the frigid water. He was already\nbreathing hard as he returned. Again, hopelessness seeped into him like the icy\nrain seeping into his hide.\n\nAkir's body was still there at the doorway. The rain washed away most of the\nblood, but it couldn't cleanse the ground of the crimson stains.\n\nBlade whimpered and dragged Akir's body into their home. The tarp to their\ndoorway was missing, so the rain splattered at the doorway and dripped into\ntheir hovel. As soon as Akir's body was away from the door, Blade collapsed on\nhim, crying and drowning in his sorrow again.\n\nIt felt like Blade cried for eternity. He wanted to cry more, but no more tears\nwould come out. His sadness was slowly being consumed by a festering anger\ninside of him. It boiled his blood to the point that he was shaking. Blade\nclenched his paws together and struggled to stand. He looked over Akir's body,\ninspecting it for any clues to his killers.\n\nHe found many bruises from either punches or kicks. There were many clean cuts\nand gouges in his hide from swords or other sharp objects. No claws. Then the\ngaping hole in his chest meant only one thing: Akir had been shot.\n\nA vicious snarl formed at Blade's lips. Humans. But who and why?\n\nBlade growled and swiped at the nearest breakable thing: Asha's crib. It\nshattered into hundreds of wooden pieces. He stamped his paws and found the next\nbreakable thing: a chair for Talia. He attacked every possible wooden object\nuntil they were all shattered into thousands of pieces littering the stone\nfloor.\n\nHe clutched his chest and started to cough. It hurt... He hurt...So much pain.\nBlade cried out a somber wail and toppled to the side. The pain was too\nmuch—he'd never felt this much pain before. Blade roared and thrashed, trying to\nexpel the building anguish and agony that manifested inside him like a demon\nseizing his soul, but he couldn't fight it.\n\nRage consumed him.\n\nThen Blade charged out of the house and took to the stormy skies. He flew\nstraight toward the palace district with an insatiable fire burning in his\nheart. His mind was empty except for the desire to kill—a bloodlust. He couldn't\nthink straight nor could he really think at all. He was lost in reckless\nabandon, intent on killing every last human until he avenged Akir's death. But,\nhis primary goal was their leader. If he killed their leader, then that would be\nenough.\n\nHardly anyone was outside. Everyone was taking shelter from the storm as it\nraged on, pouring nearly horizontal sheets of rain over the city. The gusts of\nwind ripped Blade's wings back several times, almost throwing him off balance.\nLightning struck nearby, cracking and thundering loud enough that Blade's ears\nrang for a moment. He didn't regard a single inkling of thought for his own\nsafety and continued on.\n\nWhatever happened to him tonight was in the hands of fate.\n\nBlade's first victim was a lone guard donned in heavy plate metal. He carried\naround a light, seeming to be searching for anyone caught in the storm.\n\nBlade descended on him and smashed the human's body into the ground. He pulled\noff the man's helmet and then relentlessly slashed across his face as painful\nscreams escaped his mouth all until Blade jabbed his claws into his throat.\n\nWith a roar, Blade claimed his first kill, and then the thunder echoed back.\n\nA door opened to a house directly next to him. A woman stared at him in horror\nwith her hand over her mouth. Blade growled at her and thought about killing her\ntoo, but she was innocent. He wouldn't kill the defenseless.\n\nHe moved swiftly through the streets of the palace district, hunting for the\nnext unlucky human to cross his path. He happened upon another guard, but this\none had seen him first. He bared his sword and shield, putting up a fight.\n\nBut Blade smashed his shoulder into the shield before the guard could even raise\nhis sword. The man staggered back, and Blade ripped the shield away with a\ncrack, breaking the man's arm before he lunged and bit into his exposed neck.\nSharp teeth clamped down on the human's flesh, tearing into it as blood filled\nhis maw. Blade jerked his head and ended the guard's life. He spit the bile out\nand growled viciously before continuing on again.\n\nIt felt good to kill.\n\nBetween two giant pillars was one of the entrances into the main palace. Blade\nfelt small when he looked up at the towering colonnade, but he didn't let that\nintimidate him. He was sure that this was where he would find Akir's killers,\neven though he truly had no idea who they were. Usually it was heavily guarded\naround the palace grounds, but Blade only saw two guards.\n\nThe guards rushed forward with pikes from the colonnade, shouting at him to\nstop. Blade ignored them, so they attacked.\n\nBlade jumped back to avoid one of the spears, but the other caught his flank. He\ngrowled and quickly grabbed the spear that had jabbed him and ripped it away\nfrom the man, causing the guard to stumble forward into his lethally placed\nswipe. Blade caught the human's armored head and smashed it into the ground.\n\nThe other guard used this opportunity to attack Blade again, but he deflected\nthe strike just in time and jumped back. Another attack jabbed at him, and Blade\ncaught the wood between his teeth and bit down, breaking the sharp end off.\n\nThe screech of dagger rang out, and the guard bravely charged Blade. Blade\nside-stepped and avoided the attack completely as the guard lost his footing on\nthe slick cobblestones, falling flatly onto his face. Blade didn't waste a\nmoment and mercilessly killed the guard.\n\nA groan escaped the first guard's lips, and Blade ended his life too. He wiped\nhis bloody paws on the wet ground and winced as pain shot through his side. Warm\nblood seeped through his feathers as Blade clutched his wound. He growled and\npushed through the pain, stepping up to two tall and wide doors. He wondered\nwhere the rest of the palace's guards were, and he figured they would all be\ninside.\n\n\"I'm going to die here,\" he muttered and pushed the door open.\n\nInside the vestibule, the floors were made of polished white and black marble. A\nshort hallway connected to a long corridor running horizontally with drapes and\nbanners hanging from the walls. Everything looked so elegant that Blade couldn't\nfathom how much money went to building this one building.\n\nSurprisingly, it was very quiet and there weren't any guards nearby. Was the\nsecurity always so loose?\n\nClaws clacked on the marble as Blade took a right down the corridor. He checked\nthe first door and it opened up to an empty room. He shut it and continued on,\nchecking each and every door and finding absolutely no one. There were so many\nrooms and doors that he wasn't sure where the ruler of the city would be. He had\nno idea what that human even looked like, but he figured he should have at least\nfound some nobles—or even just some servants.\n\nThe rain pattered against glass windows to a courtyard, and the lightning\nflashed continuously. Thunder nearly shook the giant building, rattling the\nglass panes. Blade heard a soft plop and looked down, noticing a droplet of his\nblood staining the floor. He grimaced.\n\nArmor clanked behind him, and a guard quickly approached. \"What are you doing\nhere!? Stop where you are!\" He withdrew a sword and angled it at the dragon.\n\nBlade growled and turned around, his tail flicking behind him as he crouched\ndown, teeth bared.\n\n\"You're under arrest for trespassing on palace grounds, beast. Stand down and\ncome quietly.\"\n\nBlade was surprised that the guard didn't immediately attack him, but that\ndidn't matter. He would end the wretch's life.\n\nHe stepped toward the guard threateningly, ready to tear him apart. Not a single\nounce of fear shown in the human's eyes. He stood his ground against the larger\ndragon, watching and following him with a sword. This obviously wasn't his first\nfight with a feral dragon.\n\n\"I warned you, dragon.\" The man raised his sword and swung at Blade. Blade\nducked beneath it, nearly getting his head lopped off. Then he lunged and clawed\nat armor, his claws harmlessly scraping it. He knocked the man back with his\nstrike, giving him enough room to pounce and take the human to the ground, but\nnot before his sword sliced across Blade's vulnerable belly.\n\nBlade roared and snapped at the man's head, but he caught an arm instead. He\nfelt his teeth sink into the armor and his flesh as the man cried out in pain.\nHe twisted his head and tore into the limb, but he had to release it quickly to\navoid being stabbed.\n\nHe retreated back a step, breathing raggedly between his teeth. More blood\ndripped onto the ground while pain made his muscles tense up. His mouth was\nfilled with the warm, metallic taste of fresh blood.\n\nThe guard climbed to his feet, his left arm hanging limply at his side with\nblood oozing down it. With his sword in the other hand, he pointed it at Blade\nand then gave a yell as he charged forward. Blade again barely dodged his\nstrike, but took the opportunity to rush and knock the wind out of the human\nwith his shoulder.\n\nBlade followed his initial attack with his claws to the human's neck. He missed\nand luckily got hit with the broad side of the sword against the side of his\nmuzzle instead of the blade. Tears brimmed in his eyes as his vision swirled. He\nstumbled to the side and had to jump backward to avoid another attack.\n\nBlade growled viciously and hissed with irritation. He'd never met a human so\nskilled in fighting before. Their fight had taken too long, and now there were\nanother two guards rushing at him from behind, having heard the commotion.\n\nBlade whirled around and dodged both of their attacks, and then he had to jump\naway again as the first guard attacked from behind. His sharp sword caught his\ntail, sending more pain through Blade. He now faced three guards, and one of\nthem had a pike.\n\nThe wounded guard retreated behind the other two, clutching his bleeding arm\nwith his sword arm. The right guard attacked Blade head on, and the guard with\nthe pike followed the attack with his own. Blade dodged the sword and tapped the\npike away just before dodging the sword again. He hissed as the spear head\ngrazed his neck on its second stab.\n\nBlade stamped his forepaw down as he caught the handle and broke the spear\nagainst the ground. He spun around and used his tail to catch the other man off\nguard, thwacking him painfully hard in the hip, knocking him to the side. Blade\nsurged forward in his opening and pounced on the wounded guard behind the other\ntwo. He caught him by surprise and killed him with a bite to the neck before he\ncould defend himself.\n\n\"Captain!\"\n\nBlade swiftly jumped away and crouched low again. He was breathing hard and\nbleeding from several places, but his golden eyes were lit with ferocity. A\nsnarl formed at his lips as he elicited another feral growl. He stood his ground\nand waited for the next attack.\n\nThe guards were shouting and calling for reinforcements, giving Blade little to\nno time. He quickly rushed them, forcing their attacks. The guard raised his\nsword high, and as soon as he did Blade tackled him to the ground. The sword\ncaught one of his horns when it came down, rattling Blade's skull, but it didn't\nharm him otherwise. He swiped the polearm away with his tail, blocking the\nattack as he killed the other guard.\n\nWith bloodied claws, Blade swiveled around and viciously swiped at the other\nguard repeatedly, forcing him on the defensive until he broke his guard and\nkilled him too.\n\nBlade hobbled away as quickly as he could, panting and trying to regain his\nfocus. He was already exhausted and his vision felt weaker and weaker the longer\nhe continued. A trail of blood followed behind him as he limped through the\ncorridor. His legs trembled beneath him, but he still had fight left in him.\n\nHe didn't have time to check every door anymore. Instead, he searched for a\nthrone room or whatever the biggest and fanciest room was. He truly had no idea\nwhere to even look... but he was determined.\n\nBefore turning a corner, Blade poked his head around and saw at least eight\nguards standing with halberds at their sides, lined up against two walls leading\ntoward a large door. It looked like a lobby of sorts before a throne room. If he\nwas going to do this, he had to do it quick.\n\nBlade roared and charged in, immediately ramming the first guard into the wall\nwith full force, crushing his armor and banging his head harshly into the stone.\nHe fell, and Blade was rushing toward the next person. He sliced his throat open\nwith his talons and pounced on the next guard before he could attack.\n\nOne by one, each of the guards fell. They were too spread out, giving Blade just\nenough time to kill them before the next one came. As the last guard's body hit\nthe ground, Blade watched the large door creak open, and another column of\nguards rushed in.\n\n\"Kill it!\" someone shouted. \"I want his head!\"\n\nBlade growled and pinned his ears back. He wanted to fight them, and he wanted\nto rip them all apart... but he knew he would die before he would even make a\ndent. There were too many.\n\nBut Akir... he desperately wanted to avenge his fallen mate. He needed to get\npast these guards to get to the leader, but Blade didn't want to die. Not yet...\n\nBlade turned around and sprinted the way he came. He heard the guards shouting\nand chasing him with their rattling armor following behind. Blade nearly slipped\nand fell as he scrambled away, his paws soaked with blood. The marble floors\ndidn't give anything for his claws to grasp.\n\nHe slid around the corner and found himself face to face with four more guards\ninspecting the slain bodies he had just killed. Blade watched as one of the\nguards drew a strange looking object with a hole in the end, and then he\nrealized just too late what it was.\n\nCRACK!\n\nA burst of pain wracked Blade's right shoulder just where his neck met his body.\nHe yelped and stumbled backward before shaking it off and running as fast as he\ncould away. Hot blood poured from his wound as he strained his torn muscle. He\ncould hardly run straight, and his body was feeling weaker by the second.\n\nBlade had no idea where he was, and he kept running into more and more guards.\nThey seemed to be on full alert now. By the time he finally found an exit, it\nwas blocked off by several guards.\n\nThe guards chasing him were rapidly closing in. He reached a dead end with\nnowhere to go... This was it.\n\nBlade was going to die.\n\nBlade backed up until his tail brushed against the wall. He was trapped in\nanother hallway, with guards rapidly closing in on him from both sides. He\nlooked between both of the groups verging on him and felt his emotions catching\nup with him.\n\nHe was scared; he didn't want to die. His vengeance had failed, and he didn't\neven come close. All of his efforts had been futile, and he was about to meet\nthe end of it all. What comes after death?\n\n\"Akir... I'm so sorry,\" Blade said beneath his heavy breaths, starting to cry.\nHe'd never see his mate again, or his daughter, or even Talia. One guard raised\na gun and pointed it directly at Blade.\n\nBlade lowered his head and accepted his defeat—his end. More and more memories\nflooded his fading vision, bringing a small smile to his lips. Maybe he would\nsee Akir in the afterlife...\n\nThe loud crack of the gun sounded and rang in Blade's ears, but he quickly\nrealized that he hadn't been shot. Miraculously, he was alive. He wondered how\nand why, but he knew he wouldn't live for much longer anyway.\n\nBlade quickly looked behind him and noticed the glass to a window had been\ncompletely shattered. Why hadn't I thought of that?\n\nHe took advantage of the guard's missed shot and leapt through the window into\nthe courtyard. Rain still poured from the sky, pelting Blade's blood-soaked\nfeathers, and lightning crackled through the darkness. Another gunshot sounded\nbehind him, and he heard the bullet whizz by and strike the ground near him.\n\nWas fate giving him a second chance?\n\nAn open sky was all Blade needed. He jumped into the air on trembling legs and\nbarely had enough strength to climb up, but he managed.\n\nThen as he cleared the walls, a sudden burst of wind carried him away, knocking\nhim off balance and sending him flying backward. Blade hissed and twisted around\nquickly before he crashed into the roof. With the wind pushing him forward, he\nused it to glide and find his way around.\n\nThen he remembered that the palace was protected by a magical barrier and felt\napprehensive to continue forward, but he couldn't stop himself. He winced\nexpectantly, but before he knew it, he was outside the palace district,\nunscathed by any magic. But Blade didn't know how much longer he could fly. He\nwas already pushing past his limits, and it was thanks to the powerful wind that\nhe was even still in the air.\n\nLuckily for him, he flew over the district Talia lived in. As long as he\nwouldn't get struck by lightning, all he had to do was glide down.\n\nAnd Blade landed soon after. His head darted back and forth, searching for\nTalia's street. He could hardly see straight as blood from an unknown wound\ndripped into his eyes. Blade hobbled and limped around until he recognized some\nof the area. He found Talia's house soon after and struggled to pull himself\nthere.\n\nBy now, he was weak, freezing, and nearly about to die. He knocked on Talia's\ndoor weakly, hardly able to even raise his good arm. He waited... and waited...\nbut she didn't answer. He tried the door latch, but it was locked. Blade groaned\nin pain and banged his head against the door.\n\nHe heard the latch come undone and the door flung open.\n\n\"Oh my God...\" Talia immediately stepped aside to let Blade inside and locked\nthe door behind them. She wrapped her arms around his belly and helped drag him\ninside, but she had grabbed one of his cuts and caused him a lot of pain.\n\nBlade tried to keep standing, but he fell and cried out in pain. A series of\nquestions spouted from Talia's mouth, but he couldn't even answer one of them.\nHis head was spinning and his ears were ringing. Could he even hear her?\n\n\"You're not going to die, Blade,\" she reassured. \"I'm going to keep you alive.\nStay with me... Don't fall asleep.\"\n\nBlade nodded meekly, but he could already feel himself starting to slip away.\nEven in Talia's warm home he felt like icicles were pricking his hide, and in\nsome places it felt like they were stabbing him.\n\n\"It's... It's c-cold...\"\n\n\"Stay with me, Blade!\" she shouted and tapped his muzzle firmly. She was rushing\naround and grabbing her supplies. Blade winced and hissed as she pressed a cloth\nto his side against his gaping wound. It stung terribly, but his numbness saved\nhim from some of the pain. He remembered the first time he had ever met Talia,\nand it was a situation pretty similar to this.\n\nExcept, Blade wasn't sure if she could save him this time.\n\nThen more and more areas were stinging, making his ragged, blood-soaked feathers\npuff out and his body tremble. He shut his eyes tight and moaned painfully. It\nwas growing increasingly harder to stay awake. After a while, his body felt\ncompletely and utterly numb. He wasn't even sure if he was breathing anymore.\n\nTalia tended to him, constantly saying things that Blade couldn't hear or\nunderstand, but it reassured him to know that she was trying to comfort him. She\nhad him flip onto his other side, and that was the last thing Blade did. His\nhead suddenly felt extremely dizzy and light. He tried to keep his eyes open...\nHe tried to stay awake... But he couldn't fight anymore.\n\nIt was over."
