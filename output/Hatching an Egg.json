And then\nafter that, he would have to wait for it to hatch! He felt all too excited and\nhe didn't want to wait however many months it would take. Akir was really\nexcited too, but he tried not to act like it. Blade could easily tell, since\nAkir would check on Vespera almost every day to see if she laid the egg.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It wasn't until three weeks later that Akir came bursting\nthrough their door, startling Talia who had been resting in her wooden chair,\nand Blade who was lying next to her. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He hardly gave them a chance to ask what was happening\nbefore he said, \"She laid the egg!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade hopped up onto his paws, his tail swishing excitedly\nbehind him. \"R-really?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nodded and beckoned with his wings for Blade to come.\nBlade glanced at Talia with a big, toothy smile. She returned the smile and urged\nhim to go with the wave of her hands. Blade nodded and quickly padded out the\ndoor. He and Akir took off to the skies, flapping their wings as they angled\ntowards Vespera's home.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">They arrived in no time, and Vespera invited them in moments\nlater. Blade dipped his head in greeting and she did the same with a grin.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Wow, that was fast,&#8221; she remarked and giggled. \"I guess you\ntwo are pretty excited, huh?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The egg was nestled in a few rolls of furs, gently placed in\nthe middle of the soft protection. Akir and Blade stepped over to it with big\nsmiles on their muzzles. Akir sniffed the egg curiously and looked at Vespera.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Can I hold it?&#8221; he asked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She nodded and chuckled. \"It is your egg after all. As much\nas I wish I could keep it, I made sure I wouldn't get attached to it. You can\ntake it home with you whenever you want.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sat next to Akir and watched him hold the egg. He saw\na glint of something in his sapphire eyes. He couldn't tell exactly if it was\npride or happiness, but it was probably a mixture of both.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Thank you, Vespera. We'll gladly take it with us.&#8221; Akir\nsmiled softly at Blade and handed him the egg. \"Careful!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade reached out and grabbed it, pulling it close to his fluffy\nchest. It was very smooth and as white as his claws. It was heavy, too, about\nas big as his head. He gently caressed it and felt it teeming with warmth.\nBlade couldn't shake the smile from his lips. This was his egg that he created.\nHe was going to be a father, and Akir was too! Whatever little hatchling inside\nwould be theirs.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He gave the egg back to Akir who took it and placed it back\nin the furs. \"I can't thank you enough, Vespera... You've made us both very\nhappy.&#8221; Blade gave her a kind nuzzle.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It was my pleasure,&#8221; she said. \"I think you two will be\nawesome parents&#8212;better than me, anyway!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and gave her an affectionate nuzzle. \"We'll\nbring our hatchling around so you can see him or her. It's the least we can\ndo.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Vespera nodded. \"What will you name it? Oh, I hope it's\nfemale! Females can have such pretty names.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir glanced back at Blade and shrugged his wings. \"We haven't\nreally talked about it.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Well, if you need any help, I'd be more than willing! I\nknow a lot of pretty names, and handsome names too.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"We'll let you know.&#8221; Akir grinned and chuckled. \"Shall we\nshow Talia our egg?&#8221; he asked Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade smiled and nodded eagerly. Akir picked the egg up and\ntucked it carefully against his body. \"We'll be around, Vespera,&#8221; he said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She smiled softly and nodded as she stared at the egg. \"I'll\nbe here.&#8221; </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade could tell that she was a little sad to see them go.\nHe felt sorry for her, seeing how they were taking the egg that she laid. Even\nthough they had agreed that Blade and Akir were the parents, she was still\nbiologically the mother of their hatchling. Motherly instincts told her to care\nfor her egg, so it must have been hard for her to let it go.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir and Blade waved at her with a wing as they stepped out\ninto the bright, sunny day. The door shut behind them, and they took off into\nthe cloudy sky. Akir held the egg firmly against his chest as they flew. A look\nof determination furrowed his brow, seeming to be putting all of his effort\ninto making sure there was no chance to drop the egg. Blade grinned and flew\nbelow him... just in case!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When they returned home, they brought the egg to Talia with\nbig smiles on their faces. She chuckled and took the egg and sat it in her lap,\nadmiring it with a kind expression.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So, you two are going to be parents now?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded excitedly and gave Akir a small kiss. Normally,\nAkir wasn't very affectionate when Talia was around, but this time he kissed\nBlade right back without hesitation.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"How long will it take for the egg to hatch?&#8221; Blade asked\nher. He sat on his haunches next to her chair, peering at his egg.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, I don't know, Blade... Our eggs usually take about a\nmonth to hatch. I'm not sure if ferals are the same way or not.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and hoped that the egg would hatch soon. Blade\ntook it back from Talia and cradled it in his arms with a big, toothy grin\nspreading his lips. He glanced up at Akir and looked adoringly into his blue\neyes.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir stepped around behind Blade and embraced him from\nbehind, nuzzling at his neck while he held him against his blue and purple\nunderside. Blade purred affectionately, fluffing up his black and gold\nfeathers. He and Akir both held the egg and watched it together&#8212;completely\noblivious to Talia, who was smiling softly at them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You two remind me a lot of my children,&#8221; she said quietly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Both Blade and Akir looked up at her as she leaned back in\nher chair, and Blade asked with surprise, \"You had children?&#8221; Talia had never talked\nmuch about her past before. It was never really brought up, but the few times\nBlade had asked any personal questions she dismissed them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I do. Two handsome sons that have moved on from this city&#8212;a\nmuch better choice than what I made.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sensed a bit of longing in her voice. \"When was the\nlast time you saw them?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia sighed and picked at the armrests to her chair. \"Many\ndecades ago,&#8221; she answered, \"back when my first grandchild was born to my\noldest. He and his wife decided that this city wasn't safe to raise their\nhatchling in, and I couldn't have agreed more. So they took a ship to one of\nthe continents&#8212;I'm not sure really where. My youngest stayed with me for\nseveral years after until he decided the same, though he did try to get me to\ncome with him.&#8221; </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia stared ahead, her pale-yellow eyes filled with\nthought. The light from the window caught her face, showing the age in her scales\nand how dull her green scales really were. Blade wondered how old she actually\nwas, knowing that most two-legs lived half as long as ferals.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why did you stay?&#8221; Akir asked curiously.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I was born and raised here... It is my home. People needed me\nhere to tend to them. But as time continued, I was needed less and less. You\nand Blade have been my only patients in the last two years,&#8221; she said glumly.\n\"The city doesn't need me anymore, but I'm too old now to leave.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"How old are you, Talia?&#8221; Blade asked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She chuckled and shrugged her shoulders. \"Too old,&#8221; she\nanswered. She pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes at them. \"You two should\nmove on too... Find someplace else away from this godforsaken land.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's embrace tightened around Blade, but he remained\nsilent.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I've thought about it,&#8221; Blade said and nuzzled his mate. \"But\nI haven't talked to Akir about it yet.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir looked away and made a grunt. He seemed to be thinking\ndeeply about something that Blade couldn't place, which brought a little worry\nto his mind.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"If you can find a ship willing to carry ferals, do it,&#8221;\nTalia stated firmly. \"It may just be my bones getting old and jittery, but I\nfeel like there is a storm coming. A big one. Something that will cause a lot\nof chaos, and I'd hate to see you two get caught in the middle of it.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"But what about you, Talia?&#8221; Blade asked worriedly. \"I don't\nwant to leave you behind.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She smiled and shook her head. \"I'll be fine. If I die, then\nI die. No one will miss me, and I've nothing left on this world.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade thought over her words and curled his tail with hers\nas he looked into her eyes. \"I would miss you...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I would too,&#8221; Akir said kindly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia's face softened and she turned her head away. \"You\ntwo...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade placed a paw on her hand resting on the wooden arm of\nher chair. \"If we leave, you should come with us.&#8221; Blade had never seen Talia\nso close to crying before. He squeezed her hand and smiled widely at her.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'll think about it,&#8221; she said and chuckled.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">For most of the evening, the three of them talked about how\nto raise a hatchling and what it would be like. The more they talked about it,\nthe more Blade realized how hard it will be to raise his own hatchling, but he\nknew it would be well worth it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir seemed to mostly be in his own world, not saying much.\nEvery time Blade looked at him, he could see that he was still thinking about\nsomething. It made him worry.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After that, Blade and Akir took the egg to their room and\nmade a little bed of furs for it and set it down safe in a corner, wrapped in a\nwarm cocoon. Then they climbed onto their bed together and intimately cuddled.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir curled up with Blade, pressing his underbelly against\nBlade's back. Warm scales rubbed against Blade's black and gold feathers as\nAkir hugged his mate, his limbs wrapping around Blade's smaller body. Their\ntails twined together while their Blade's feathers melded into Akir's larger\nbody.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What are you worried about?&#8221; Blade asked and held one of\nAkir's paws.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir was silent for a moment before he replied, \"Nothing,\nBlade. Everything is okay.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You can talk to me,&#8221; he pushed. He squeezed Akir's paw\nlovingly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir sighed and nuzzled into Blade's neck. \"It's fine... I've\njust been... thinking about our future together.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What about it?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and nibbled on Blade's neck. \"Aren't you just\nfull of questions? Just relax, Blade.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade dropped it for the moment and nodded, still feeling a\nlittle worried. But as they snuggled together, he started to forget about it. Akir's\npaw gently caressed Blade's flank and underbelly, sifting through his soft\nfeathers. Blade elicited a contented sigh, relaxing as he closed his eyes and\nleaned into Akir. All of the excitement for the day trickled away, leaving\nBlade with a calm mind as he was wrapped in his mate's embrace.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I love this, Akir,&#8221; he said. \"I love being with you. You\nmake me feel... good.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade couldn't see the big, toothy smile that spread Akir's\nlips. \"I love being with you too... more than else.&#8221; </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir licked the back of Blade's neck affectionately,\ngrooming his feathers while his paw rubbed him up and down. He squeezed Blade's\ntail and then started to play with his hind paws with his own, their toes mingling\nand rubbing together.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Do you think we'll always be like this?&#8221; Blade asked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Like what? Mates?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded. \"Like... will we always have moments like this?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir kissed at Blade's cheek and chuckled. \"I think so,\nBlade. I don't see why not. When we're older, we probably won't be mating as\nmuch though, if that's what you're worried about.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and shook his head. \"I'm not too worried about\nthat... I just really enjoy being with you.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I enjoy being with you too,&#8221; Akir replied.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade purred softly while Akir's licks traveled around to\nthe front of his neck. Blade stretched his neck out and exposed it to his mate,\nenjoying the sensual attention as the tongue doted his sensitive feathers. He\nchuckled quietly and rubbed his footpaws against Akir's, the soft, feathers on\ntop of his paw rubbing against Akir's pawpads. His rump nestled in perfectly\nbetween Akir's hind legs, and Blade could feel the warmth of his mate's nethers\npushing against his rear end.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Lusts riled up Blade's mind while he grinded his hind end\nbetween Akir's legs. Akir groaned softly and nipped at Blade's neck.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Mmm... Someone is trying to get into some trouble,&#8221; Akir\ncooed. \"Talia might hear us, you know.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade hadn't really thought of that. \"Let's just be really quiet,&#8221;\nhe said and squeezed Akir's footpaw. He already felt his sheath stirring with\nhis arousal. Being so close and intimate with Akir brought many warm feelings\nflowing through his body, and he could hardly resist the temptation.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir purred delightedly in response and started to get\nfriskier. His paw rubbed and caressed Blade's soft lower belly while his claws\ngently grazed through his golden feathers. Blade cooed softly and nuzzled his\nmate lovingly. Akir chuckled and dipped his paw between Blade's hind legs. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"O-oh, Akir...&#8221; Blade gasped quietly and lifted his rear leg,\ninviting Akir's sensuous touch. His paw gripped and stroked Blade's squishy\nsheath up and down. Arousal set in and warmed Blade's cheeks and loins while\nhis flesh was stimulated. It stiffened inside his sheath as Akir groped it and\ncoaxed it out.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Let me feel your cock again,&#8221; Akir whispered into Blade's\near.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade held back a moan and flexed his toes, squeezing Akir's\ntoes as their footpaws locked. Akir's paw touched and rubbed his growing spire.\nAkir cooed encouragingly to Blade as he stroked his cock up and down. Then he\nrubbed Blade's orbs in a circular motion before gently squeezing them and\nrolling them in his paw.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Nngh... That feels g-good...&#8221; </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir gave Blade's cock a firm squeeze and slid his paw from\nthe base of his shaft, up past his ridges, and to his tapered tip. \"You like\nthat, cutie?&#8221; he crooned. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed warmly and nodded, shuddering as pleasure\ncoursed through him. He moaned gently as Akir gripped his cock and rubbed it up\nand down repeatedly. His length was soon\nhard and twitching within his mate's firm grasp.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's strokes continued as Blade groaned and grunted as\nquietly as he could. Pleasure warmed his loins while his cock was rubbed from\nhis tip to his sheath. The strokes were slow at first. Akir rhythmically\nsqueezed and massaged Blade's flesh from one end to the other, sending warm,\nblissful waves through him. Akir's paw was soft and gentle, and Blade could\nfeel his pawpads rubbing against his ridges and kneading into the base of his\nshaft. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade relaxed and kept his legs splayed apart, giving his\nmate plenty of room to pleasure him. He loved receiving attention like this\nfrom Akir. He stifled another moan and flexed his toes while their hind paws\nwere still locked, expressing his pleasure. Akir's strokes gained speed, and\nBlade's dangling orbs were soon bouncing back and forth between his legs while\nhis mate worked his cock up and down quickly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Aaaah... A-Akir...&#8221; Blade could feel his mate's warm and erect\nflesh pushing into his feathers as Akir grinded into his rump. His blush deepened as he thought about taking\nthat cock again. He thought about the amazing feeling of his mate's flesh\nburying deep into his rear, opening him up to fill him with his seed. Blade groaned\nquietly again as a deep blush set in his cheeks. He needed that satisfaction!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">While Akir continued to jack him off, Blade lifted his rear\nleg higher and moved their twined tails over Akir's body to expose his tailhole\nto his mate. Akir was quick to move around and bring his hind end forward. His\ntorso wrapped around Blade's while his hips pushed up against Blade's fluffy rump.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade felt Akir's cock slipping and sliding around beneath\nhis tail while his mate searched for his entrance. Blade shuddered when he\nfound it, feeling the warm tip of his cock pushing at his puckered muscles.\nThen he gasped and groaned as Akir pressed it into him, probably a bit too\nloudly. Akir's thick girth spread apart his rump while it forced its way\nthrough Blade's clenching muscles. Blade could feel his walls being pushed\napart as his mate's large, smooth cock slid deeper inside him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That's it, Blade,&#8221; Akir cooed into his ear. \"Relax...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's wings fluttered against Akir's belly as pleasure\nbloomed inside of him. It was so hard to not moan out his pleasure when it was\nbuilding so quickly inside him, wanting to burst free. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's cock stretched Blade's passage open, and Blade felt\nthe pressure deep inside him building. As his mate continued to stroke his\ncock, Blade's orgasm drew closer and closer. Pre was leaking from his tip and\naccumulating on Akir's paws, making his strokes slicker and smoother.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Ooh, Akir... D-don't stop...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir purred deeply as he lay with Blade and started to pull\nhis cock in and out of him. He humped Blade gently and slowly while holding him\nclosely. Blade gasped and softly moaned his pleasure, feeling it all\noverwhelming his senses. He panted heavily as lust brimmed inside his mind,\nready to spill over. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's cock rubbed at the sensitive spot inside his passage,\ngrinding and tugging against it. His paw gripped Blade's twitching, slick cock\nfirmly while it quickly stroked it up and down. Soft paw pads rubbed against\nhis ridged flesh, coaxing more and more pleasure from him with every up and\ndown motion. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm c-close...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Rwrrrr... that's it, Blade,&#8221; Akir moaned into Blade's ear.\n\"You're so warm and soft... Mwrrr... You feel amazing. Cum for me, cutie.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade huffed as Akir licked and nibbled along his neck. His\nmate steadily humped him, sliding his thick cock in and out of his rear. It\nrubbed against that blissful area inside Blade's rump, coaxing powerful waves\nof pleasure to flow through him. The bed lightly squeaked every so often, and\nBlade could faintly hear Akir patting against him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But Blade couldn't hold off any longer, and he didn't care\nif Talia could hear them. His feathers puffed out while he clenched and flexed\nhis toes, feeling the pressure building in his loins suddenly collapse under\nthe waves of ecstasy.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He winced and gasped for breath as his cock erupted and\nspilled his seed in rapid bursts. It coated Akir's paw while it slid up and\ndown Blade's throbbing cock. Strands of his semen sprayed onto his feathers and\nthe bed. Blade's muscles pulsed and tightened around Akir's flesh, massaging it\nas it continued to thrust in and out of him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled lowly as he was brought over the peak of\npleasure. Akir continued to hump Blade relentlessly, their bodies rocking back\nand forth. Even after Blade had expended the last of his seed, Akir was still\ngoing, making him grunt with every thrust as his sensitive passage was rubbed.\nBlade's muscles twitched and flexed around Akir's cock repeatedly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir moved his sticky paw to Blade's chest, gripping him and\npulling him into more of his thrusts while he worked toward his own orgasm.\nBlade didn't mind that his feathers were soiled with his seed. He was too lost\nin the warm feelings bathing his mind with pleasure.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"O-ooh... A-Akir...&#8221; Blade moaned softly to his mate. He closed\nhis eyes, relaxing in the pleasant feelings coursing through him. As the\nafterglow of his climax washed over his body, Akir's cock was still sending\npleasure tingling up his spine. His sensitive passage continued to flex and clench\naround his mate's flesh, making Akir quietly growl and moan his lusts.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade... t-turn onto your belly for me.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade obediently rolled onto his belly, and Akir moved with\nhim, staying connected at the hips. Blade blushed heatedly as Akir started to\nhump him harder and faster in the new position, reinvigorated. He lifted his\ntail for his mate and cooed to him encouragingly, eagerly taking his lustful\nthrusts. Now he could definitely hear Akir's crotch slapping against his rump\nwhile the bed squeaked more loudly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's belly now rested on top of Blade's back while his\narms wrapped around Blade's underbelly. He pulled Blade against him as he\nthrust into him from behind repeatedly. Blade's body rocked with his with every\ndrive of his hips. Akir huffed and panted heavily while also moaning and\ngrunting tenderly into Blade's ear.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had never felt pleasure like this before. Instead of\nall of the good feelings gathering in one area inside of him, they spread out\nand warmed his entire body pleasantly. His toes curled, his wings shuffled, and\nhis tail twitched behind him. Every time Akir's cock slid in and out of him, he\ncould feel it rubbing and massaging his tight passage. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's body felt amazing when it pressed against Blade's\nback. It was as if he could feel every powerful muscle of his working to mate\nhim. His strong forearms squeezed around his torso and pulled him into Akir's\nlap while his cock slid in and out of Blade's rump.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">And it felt amazing to let his mate use his body how he\npleased. He knew Akir was getting closer to his orgasm; he could tell from the\nrougher and more forceful thrusts that pounded against his rear. Blade relaxed\nand moaned encouragingly to Akir, wanting him to feel the same pleasure he had\nnot long ago.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then Akir suddenly growled out his lusts deep in his throat,\nslamming into Blade's rump and making his feathers flare out. Blade shuddered\nas he felt Akir's cock slide deep inside him, pulsing powerfully and filling\nhis rear with his warm essence. He could feel every throb of his mate's flesh\npushing at his clenching walls, and he could feel that warm seed trickling\ndeeper into his passage before oozing around Akir's length that was buried\ninside him</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"A-Akir... Oooh...&#8221; Blade moaned softly to his mate while Akir\ngrinded his hips against his, his cock rubbing and massaging him deeply while\nit spilled his seed. Blade could feel his slick, gooey liquid sloshing around\ninside his passage as Akir's cock moved.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir huffed and licked Blade's ear, cooing and moaning into\nit as he rode out the rest of his orgasm. \"I couldn't have asked for a more perfect\nmate,&#8221; he whispered.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade smiled happily and turned his head to nuzzle Akir\naffectionately. Akir grunted softly and rubbed his snout with Blade's, having\nhis moment in the afterglow while he hugged Blade tightly from behind. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade loved being beneath Akir. He felt safer, more\ncomfortable, and happy to have his mate's warmth covering him. He could feel\nhis sapphire-blue scales rubbing against the feathers of his back, and his\nbroad, muscular chest that pressed between his wings.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Akir... Do you think Talia uhm... heard us?&#8221; Blade asked in a\nhushed voice, feeling his cheeks flushing with warmth as he thought about the\nold dragonkin hearing them mating.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Probably,&#8221; he replied and chuckled. \"We did get a little\ntoo loud.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"But she's already walked in on us before, so it's not like\nshe isn't aware,&#8221; he added.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gulped and nodded, but he felt immediately reassured\nas Akir hugged and squeezed around him. He purred deeply in his throat and\nnuzzled under his mate's chin. He could still feel Akir's softening cock inside\nhim while his muscles twitched around it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Don't worry about it, Blade. Let's just get some rest.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grunted as Akir pulled out of him and then turned onto\nhis side to snuggle with his mate. He relaxed while they cuddled and closed his\neyes. Akir kissed him lovingly and rumbled happily as they rested together for\nthe night. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The next month couldn't have crawled by any slower for\nBlade. Every day, he and Akir would hold and nurture their egg and spend most\nof their time together with Talia. Blade was excited for the egg to hatch, and\nhe could hardly keep from asking all sorts of questions&#8212;and most of them\ncouldn't be answered. Even so, Talia was more than happy to share what she knew\nwith both of them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A week or two later, Talia had finally found another home\nfor her in the same two-leg district she lived in before. Blade and Akir helped\nher move and carried over all of the furniture they bought her before. They\nreceived plenty of looks and glares, and Blade was sure that some of the people\nthere thought they were stealing, but thankfully nothing came of it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia seemed to be happy to be on her own again, though\nBlade and Akir still visited her quite often. And now that she didn't live with\nthem anymore, they had plenty of opportunities to mate and pleasure each other.\nBlade loved it, and Akir did too, but they both knew it wouldn't be long before\ntheir egg hatched and they'd have to be secretive about it again.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">So, they took every opportunity they could to enjoy their\nprivacy while it lasted.<br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"></span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade purred with satisfaction as he licked his lips clean\nof his mate's seed, smiling up at him while he lay back with his eyes closed\nand panting for breath.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Ooh, Blade... That was wonderful,&#8221; Akir said. He sprawled out\non his back and wriggled around happily with his paws clenching at the air.\nBlade cleaned Akir's soft and drooping cock, swirling his tongue around it and\nslurping up his semen.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm glad you enjoyed it,&#8221; he replied and soon finished\ntending to his mate. \"Can we go to the feral market now? I want to find some\ntoys for our hatchling!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and nodded. \"Just let me catch my breath\nfirst, sweetie. You might want to sheathe your sword as well,&#8221; he teased.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed as he quickly glanced between his legs.\nDespite having had Akir pleasure him first, he still managed to get a raging\nerection while he had pleasured his mate. A small glob of pre formed at his tip\nwhile his length twitched needily from between his legs.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"O-oh...&#8221; Blade had a hard time keeping his cock inside him\nwhen he was around Akir, so he had learned a few tricks to help keep it down.\nHe put his two forepaws together and squeezed as tightly as he could while\nthinking about something he found.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Before too long they were both ready, so they left their\nhome with some coin to spend&#8212;and made sure their egg was tucked away safely and\ncozily in their room. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The feral district felt much more like home to Blade, seeing\nhow there were hardly and stuck-up two-legs here. Any two-legs that did come to\nthis market were just as poor as the ferals and had nowhere else to go.\nEveryone seemed to get along here, but it wasn't always the case.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir never liked to admit it, but most ferals were haughty\nand aggressive when compared to the two-legs. They'd fight over the simplest\nthings like territory or food, but violence was widely accepted anyway as long\nas no one was seriously injured. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Despite all of that, it was still way better than the actual\nmarket district deeper in the city. There wasn't as wide of a variety for goods,\nof course, but most of the tattered and worn-down stalls carried merchandise\nand necessities catering mostly to ferals.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade and Akir walked side by side down the sandy and dirt\nroad that cut between buildings that were worn-down and half falling apart. They\npassed by dragons, gryphons, wolves, cats, and everything in between. Neither\nof the two was really known here, aside from the little bit of infamy they had\nin the city, but they did meet some friendly faces.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stopped at a stall that sold stuffed toys, thinking\nthat maybe their hatchling would like a stuffed dragon to play with. Akir said\nthat he'd look for a cradle or something that Talia had mentioned at some\npoint, to keep their hatchling cozy and safe in case they wanted to have some <i>fun</i> together, uninterrupted.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade smiled as he talked with the gryphon merchant while he\ntried to find the perfect toy. He found a dark-blue dragon plushy that was made\nout of rags, but it still looked really nice. It didn't have any purple\nblotches, but Blade thought it resembled Akir in a sort of cute and adorable\nway. He bought it and put it in his satchel with a gleam in his eyes.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After that, Blade wandered around, half-looking for Akir and\nhalf-looking for another toy. Then he saw a public well not too far away&#8212;it was\njust down a small street. He felt a little parched, so he decided to go take a\ndrink.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Sitting near the well were three male dragons, seeming to be\nbasking in the sunlight. Blade smiled at them and tilted his head in greeting\nbefore dipping his head into the well and taking a few gulps.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That's ours,&#8221; the red one said. He stood up and sauntered\nover to Blade with his wings slightly extended to make himself look bigger,\nthough he was about the same size as Blade&#8212;and probably the same age. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, s-sorry,&#8221; Blade said and wiped the water from his lips.\n\"I thought it was a public well, and I-I was thirsty...&#8221; He backed away, not\nliking how the other two got up too. Blade tried to make himself as small and\nnon-threatening as possible while he looked for an opportunity to get away.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The red sniffed at Blade as he stepped too close for\ncomfort. Blade meeped and pulled away as the drake smelled his neck. He heard a\ndeep rumble in his throat as a small snarl formed at his lips.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"This one likes to lift his tail,&#8221; he said to his friends\nwith a devious grin spreading his lips. Then he looked back at Blade with a\nhungry look in his eyes. Did he smell Akir's scent on him? Blade hadn't thought\nabout that... He didn't bathe today either, and he and Akir had already mated\nonce before their oral servicing with each other.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade hadn't realized, but there was apparently a fourth\nmember to their group: a big male gryphon that stood behind him. He gulped,\nthinking that he got himself into another bad situation.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I-I'll be going n-now... Sorry for drinking your water,&#8221; he\nsaid and turned around, but a paw caught his tail and held him back.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Where do ya think you're going, tail-raiser?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade yanked away and faced them as he backed up into a\nwall. He looked up and thought he could maybe escape by lunging into the sky,\nbut he would just get caught and dragged back down before he could get\nanywhere. Fear started to settle in as he was surrounded. Where was Akir?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I don't know what y-you want from me,&#8221; he stammered. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The orange and bronze dragon growled at him. \"Why don't you\nlift that tail for us?&#8221; he said. \"Haven't had a female wander around here for\nquite some time... We could all use a little relief, and you'll have to do.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's face flushed with an intense heat as he realized\nwhat they were meaning. He shook his head vigorously and felt himself\ntrembling. How could he fight off four ferals at once? Were they really going\nto rape him?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then Akir landed behind them and roared loudly, sending\nchills down Blade's spine. He felt immensely relieved to see his mate here, and\nalmost went bolting towards him, but there were still four ferals surrounding\nhim. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What do you think you're doing!?&#8221; Akir growled and stamped\nhis talons down as he stormed toward them. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"B-Boss!?&#8221; one of them shouted in surprise, and then they\nall dispersed and fled the scene with their tails tucked between their legs. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade looked around and realized he was safe and ran to his\nmate. Akir hugged Blade tightly and enveloped him in his wings as he sat up on\nhis haunches. Blade's wings quivered and his heart raced, but the whole ordeal\nwas over before he could even think about it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Are you okay, Blade?&#8221; Akir asked worriedly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and hugged Akir tightly back, nuzzling into his\nneck. All of his fears were vanquished now that his mate was here to save him.\n\"I'm okay.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Did they do anything to you?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head. \"You got here before they could.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Thank the gods... I shouldn't have left you.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I was fine, Akir,&#8221; Blade said and pulled away from the\nembrace to lick his mate affectionately. \"I guess I should just be more careful\nwhere I go... How did you scare them away like that?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and bumped noses with Blade. \"I guess I'm just\na scary dragon.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I don't think you're scary,&#8221; Blade replied with a grin.\n\"But one of them called you <i>boss</i>?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shrugged his\nwings. \"They must have had me confused for someone else... Did you find a toy?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded happily and took out the blue plush-dragon to show\nhim. \"It looks like you!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"If I was deformed and had a stubby tail,&#8221; Akir retorted and\nchuckled as he inspected it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grinned and put it back. \"Maybe, but I think he or she\nwill love it.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled back and nodded. \"I did find a crib, but I'll\nneed your help to carry it back. It's pretty large, but it should fit in our\nhome.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Okay! Let's go then before they come back.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir and Blade returned home with their new wooden crib and\nhad a rather difficult time fitting it through the door, but they managed and\nset it up against the wall separating their room. Blade smiled and set down the\nplushy in it on top of a pile of furs they stuffed in there for the bedding.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then Akir set their egg safely into the pile of fur and put\nthe toy next to it as he grinned toothily at Blade with an adoring look in his\nsapphire eyes. Blade nuzzled Akir and kissed him, locking maws with his mate.\nOne thing quickly led to another, and Akir started to mount Blade, stepping\nover his smaller body.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade huffed and pushed his hips up into Akir's lap and felt\nhis mate's cock slide against his orbs and rub around his crotch. \"Mmm... We\nshouldn't in front of the egg,&#8221; Blade said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir licked up and down Blade's neck. He reached around to\nthe front of Blade's body too, licking under his chin and around the most\nsensitive places he could find. \"It's still just an egg, Blade,&#8221; he chuckled.\n\"It's not like he or she can see us.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gasped softly and exposed his neck to his mate briefly\nbefore slipping out from under him and flagging his tail high into the air as\nhe swaggered toward their bedroom. \"Maybe, but maybe he or she can hear us.\nWouldn't that be awkward to explain when they first hatch?&#8221; Blade teased and\nwatched Akir's hungry eyes follow his rump. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">They both stepped into the bedroom, but Akir didn't' waste\nhardly any time before he was mounting Blade again and pinning him down beneath\nhis heavier weight. Blade cried out his bliss as Akir started to mate with him\nand submitted to him. He loved how their bodies melded and moved fluidly\ntogether, gently rocking back and forth. Each and every drive of Akir's hips\nwould send pleasure tingling down Blade's spine and make his feathers fluff up\nand his crest flare out.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's thrusts gained more force the closer he was to\norgasm, pounding against Blade's rear and jouncing him forward. It wasn't much\nlonger before they both spent themselves. Their moans mixed together as each of\nthem climaxed and felt the peak of their arousal wash over them in ecstatic\nwaves of pleasure. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After that, they moved to their bed and cuddled intimately\nfor another while, expressing their love for each other physically.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Do you think we'll have a male or female?&#8221; Blade asked and\nkissed at Akir's neck.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir purred happily and pulled Blade's soft body against\nhim. His paws sifted through Blade's feathers as he caressed him. \"I don't\nknow, Blade... What are you hoping for?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade thought about it for a moment and smiled thoughtfully.\n\"I really wouldn't mind either, but I guess a female would be nice. They don't\nseem as rowdy as males are.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and licked Blade's nose. \"But there will be\nplenty of other <i>female</i> related\nissues.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Like what?&#8221; Blade asked curiously. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Lots and lots of drama,&#8221; Akir remarked. \"And then when she\ngrows up, we'll have to worry about her getting a mate!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grinned and nodded before burying his muzzle into\nAkir's neck. \"Do you think we'll be good parents?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir squeezed Blade tightly and licked his forehead. \"I\nthink so, Blade.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade purred happily and closed his eyes as warm relaxation settled\nin his body. \"I just hope he or she doesn't get confused about us...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Well, you know... We're both males. Won't he or she wonder\nwhy we're different?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and nuzzled Blade reassuringly. \"It'll be fine,\nBlade. We'll just have to introduce Vespera as their mother at some point.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and smiled. He nestled his head beneath Akir's\nchin, resting it on his mate's neck with a contented sigh. This was everything\nhe could have wanted and more.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"O-oh... Akir...&#8221; Blade moaned as he lightly humped his mate\nbeneath him, his hips patting against Akir's. \"Gods...&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Mmmm... You feel wonderful, Blade. Keep going...&#8221; Akir grunted\nand panted underneath Blade, taking his thrusts repeatedly while Blade built up\nhis speed. Blade loved how warm and tight Akir felt around his cock. His flesh\nrubbed against his mate's soft passage as it slid in and out, drawing blissful\nmoans from his lips. As good as Vespera had felt, he loved this more.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It felt strange to be the one on top, to be the one to\ndominate his mate. He liked the feeling of it: having power over his lover. It\nwas the drives of his hips that brought them both pleasure, and it was him who\nwas pinning Akir down and mating him, in control.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After pounding against his mate for some time, it wasn't\nlong before they were both brought to the pinnacle of pleasure. Blade mashed his\nballs against Akir's rump as he came inside it, filling his mate with his seed.\nAkir's muscles tightened around Blade's throbbing muscle and pulsated with his\nown orgasm that drizzled onto the floor below. Their moans mingled together\nuntil they had both satisfied themselves.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade pulled out of Akir with a messy <i>schlick</i> and flopped onto his back next to him, his chest rising and\nfalling rapidly while he panted for breath. Akir fell onto his side and did the\nsame. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That was wonderful, Akir,&#8221; Blade said once he caught his\nbreath. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It really was. Does my mate enjoy rutting me?&#8221; Akir cooed\nwith a chuckle.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade slid over to Akir and kissed him affectionately. \"I do!&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Rwrrr... I'll admit that I do love feeling you inside me from\ntime to time.&#8221; Akir kissed Blade back and lay a protective wing over him. Blade\npurred and snuggled under that wing, elated.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then they heard a quiet thump on the other side of their\nbed. Both of their heads turned, and Akir was the first to get up and see what\ncaused the noise.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade... I think it's hatching,&#8221; Akir said with a mixture of\nsurprise and hope. Blade was on his paws in an instant and rushed over to the\negg with his mate. It had rolled out of its nest and it was shaking and filling\nwith tiny cracks.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's finally hatching,&#8221; Blade mumbled. He could hardly\nbelieve that the time had finally come. After waiting for nearly two months,\ntheir hatchling was about to hatch. He wondered what it would look like, if it\nwas a boy or a girl, if it would like more like him or Vespera, and if it would\nrecognize him or Akir as its father first.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Soon enough, a black arm poked out of the shell, and then\nanother black limb followed suit. Pieces of the egg broke off until a black\nhead with stubby white horns poked out and squeaked. Blade's heart wanted to\nleap out of his chest as their hatchling climbed out of the eggshell. He\nlowered his head close to the ground, as did Akir, and cooed softly to the\nwobbly and squeaky little dragon.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade noticed that it didn't have any male parts and smiled\nsoftly at her as she looked around between him and Akir with wide, adorable,\nsilver-blue eyes. Black feathers puffed out in some places, but a lot of her\nsoft body was still covered in the egg slime. Like Blade, she had a crest of\nfeathers at the top of her head that trailed down her neck, but they were\nsilver instead of gold. She didn't have much of a mane, but she had silver\nfeathers that puffed out at the end of her tail. The rest of her body was a\nsolid, ebony black color, as dark as the night. Silver, swirly lines were\netched into the feathers around her shoulder blades, extending up her wing\njoints.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What are we going to name her?&#8221; Blade asked as she\ncuriously sniffed at his snout. He gave her a playful boop and giggled as she\nsqueaked loudly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled as he watched them. \"What was that name you\nliked? Tasha?&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Asha,&#8221; Blade corrected. \"Do you like the name Asha?&#8221; he\nasked her. She just looked at him with wide eyes and then went to inspect Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and greeted her with a very gentle nuzzle. \"I\nthink Asha is perfect.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha squeaked again and put a paw on Akir's muzzle, right on\nthe tip of his nose. Akir grinned widely and flicked his tongue out at her,\nreceiving another squeak. Blade chuckled and fetched a cloth to help clean her\nup.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He carefully petted her with it, wiping away the slimy egg\njuices from her feathers. Her black feathers puffed out after she was all dried\noff and clean. Asha wiggled and squirmed around while Blade tended to her, but\nshe didn't really protest since Akir was keeping her attention.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I can't believe we have a hatchling of our own,&#8221; Blade said\nwith a gleam of joy in his eyes.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nodded with a big, toothy grin, obviously feeling just\nas happy as Blade was. \"She's perfect.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha wobbled around until she got the hang of walking while\nshe curiously inspected every little thing that she could. Before she could\nfind anything she shouldn't, Blade and Akir took her out of their bedroom and\nlet her explore the living area.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Do you like your home, Asha?&#8221; Blade asked her as she came\ntrotting back to them. She looked up at Blade almost as if she recognized her\nname, but she didn't respond. Blade gently picked her up and tucked her to his\nchest. Asha wriggled for a moment, and then a big yawn stretched her muzzle\nwide open, revealing her tiny, razor-sharp teeth.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir wrapped a wing around Blade and nuzzled their hatchling\nlovingly. \"She's already tired,&#8221; he observed. \"Good thing we have her cradle\nset up already.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head. \"I want her to sleep with us for a\nwhile first.&#8221; He reached inside the cradle and took out the dark-blue plushy.\nAsha accepted it with what Blade thought was a happy squeak because she\nclumsily held it and examined it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled and nodded, giving Blade a quick kiss on the\ncheek. \"Sounds like a good idea, cutie.&#8221;</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's eyes met Akir's for a moment. His heart fluttered\nwith elation as Akir's joyous expression looked back at Blade. They kissed each\nother before Asha let out another squeak. Blade giggled and hugged her.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'll go take a quick nap with her,&#8221; Blade said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'll join you two.&#8221;<br /></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"></span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Vespera came to visit them a few days later, after Akir had\ntold her their egg had hatched. She was absolutely thrilled to see Asha. Blade\nsaw that motherly look in her eyes and wished that Vespera didn't have to be\nseparated from her daughter, but it was what they all agreed on. Asha was very\nfriendly with Vespera, too, giving the same curiosity that she did to Blade and\nAkir. He wondered if she knew that Vespera was her mother.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After that week had passed, when Blade felt that it was safe\nenough, they took Asha to visit Talia. They took to the streets instead of the\nskies, wanting to let Asha explore a little bit. But instead of exploring, Asha\nclung very closely to Blade&#8212;to the point that he had to hold her most of the\nway. She seemed frightened about all the sights, smells, noises, and even the\nwind that would kick up some sand. She really didn't seem to like the sand. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia was very happy to receive visitors, especially a cute\nand fluffy hatchling like Asha. She was glad to see Blade and Akir too.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Asha was very curious about Talia at first. She looked\nsimilar to the other dragons she had seen, but she walked on two legs instead\nof four. Still, it wasn't long before Asha was comfortable enough to curl up on\nTalia's lap and take a nap.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"She's very cute,&#8221; Talia said, stroking Asha's soft\nfeathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded with a smile. \"She takes after me!&#8221; Akir and\nTalia both chuckled.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I think I'm rubbing off on him,&#8221; Akir teased, giving Blade\na firm nuzzle.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and bared a toothy grin.

    "content": "HATCHING AN EGG\n\nBlade could hardly wait for Vespera to lay her egg. And then after that, he\nwould have to wait for it to hatch! He felt all too excited and he didn't want\nto wait however many months it would take. Akir was really excited too, but he\ntried not to act like it. Blade could easily tell, since Akir would check on\nVespera almost every day to see if she laid the egg.\n\nIt wasn't until three weeks later that Akir came bursting through their door,\nstartling Talia who had been resting in her wooden chair, and Blade who was\nlying next to her.\n\nHe hardly gave them a chance to ask what was happening before he said, \"She laid\nthe egg!”\n\nBlade hopped up onto his paws, his tail swishing excitedly behind him.\n\"R-really?”\n\nAkir nodded and beckoned with his wings for Blade to come. Blade glanced at\nTalia with a big, toothy smile. She returned the smile and urged him to go with\nthe wave of her hands. Blade nodded and quickly padded out the door. He and Akir\ntook off to the skies, flapping their wings as they angled towards Vespera's\nhome.\n\nThey arrived in no time, and Vespera invited them in moments later. Blade dipped\nhis head in greeting and she did the same with a grin.\n\n\"Wow, that was fast,” she remarked and giggled. \"I guess you two are pretty\nexcited, huh?”\n\nThe egg was nestled in a few rolls of furs, gently placed in the middle of the\nsoft protection. Akir and Blade stepped over to it with big smiles on their\nmuzzles. Akir sniffed the egg curiously and looked at Vespera.\n\n\"Can I hold it?” he asked.\n\nShe nodded and chuckled. \"It is your egg after all. As much as I wish I could\nkeep it, I made sure I wouldn't get attached to it. You can take it home with\nyou whenever you want.”\n\nBlade sat next to Akir and watched him hold the egg. He saw a glint of something\nin his sapphire eyes. He couldn't tell exactly if it was pride or happiness, but\nit was probably a mixture of both.\n\n\"Thank you, Vespera. We'll gladly take it with us.” Akir smiled softly at Blade\nand handed him the egg. \"Careful!”\n\nBlade reached out and grabbed it, pulling it close to his fluffy chest. It was\nvery smooth and as white as his claws. It was heavy, too, about as big as his\nhead. He gently caressed it and felt it teeming with warmth. Blade couldn't\nshake the smile from his lips. This was his egg that he created. He was going to\nbe a father, and Akir was too! Whatever little hatchling inside would be theirs.\n\nHe gave the egg back to Akir who took it and placed it back in the furs. \"I\ncan't thank you enough, Vespera... You've made us both very happy.” Blade gave\nher a kind nuzzle.\n\n\"It was my pleasure,” she said. \"I think you two will be awesome parents—better\nthan me, anyway!”\n\nAkir chuckled and gave her an affectionate nuzzle. \"We'll bring our hatchling\naround so you can see him or her. It's the least we can do.”\n\nVespera nodded. \"What will you name it? Oh, I hope it's female! Females can have\nsuch pretty names.”\n\nAkir glanced back at Blade and shrugged his wings. \"We haven't really talked\nabout it.”\n\n\"Well, if you need any help, I'd be more than willing! I know a lot of pretty\nnames, and handsome names too.”\n\n\"We'll let you know.” Akir grinned and chuckled. \"Shall we show Talia our egg?”\nhe asked Blade.\n\nBlade smiled and nodded eagerly. Akir picked the egg up and tucked it carefully\nagainst his body. \"We'll be around, Vespera,” he said.\n\nShe smiled softly and nodded as she stared at the egg. \"I'll be here.”\n\nBlade could tell that she was a little sad to see them go. He felt sorry for\nher, seeing how they were taking the egg that she laid. Even though they had\nagreed that Blade and Akir were the parents, she was still biologically the\nmother of their hatchling. Motherly instincts told her to care for her egg, so\nit must have been hard for her to let it go.\n\nAkir and Blade waved at her with a wing as they stepped out into the bright,\nsunny day. The door shut behind them, and they took off into the cloudy sky.\nAkir held the egg firmly against his chest as they flew. A look of determination\nfurrowed his brow, seeming to be putting all of his effort into making sure\nthere was no chance to drop the egg. Blade grinned and flew below him... just in\ncase!\n\nWhen they returned home, they brought the egg to Talia with big smiles on their\nfaces. She chuckled and took the egg and sat it in her lap, admiring it with a\nkind expression.\n\n\"So, you two are going to be parents now?”\n\nBlade nodded excitedly and gave Akir a small kiss. Normally, Akir wasn't very\naffectionate when Talia was around, but this time he kissed Blade right back\nwithout hesitation.\n\n\"How long will it take for the egg to hatch?” Blade asked her. He sat on his\nhaunches next to her chair, peering at his egg.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, Blade... Our eggs usually take about a month to hatch. I'm\nnot sure if ferals are the same way or not.”\n\nBlade nodded and hoped that the egg would hatch soon. Blade took it back from\nTalia and cradled it in his arms with a big, toothy grin spreading his lips. He\nglanced up at Akir and looked adoringly into his blue eyes.\n\nAkir stepped around behind Blade and embraced him from behind, nuzzling at his\nneck while he held him against his blue and purple underside. Blade purred\naffectionately, fluffing up his black and gold feathers. He and Akir both held\nthe egg and watched it together—completely oblivious to Talia, who was smiling\nsoftly at them.\n\n\"You two remind me a lot of my children,” she said quietly.\n\nBoth Blade and Akir looked up at her as she leaned back in her chair, and Blade\nasked with surprise, \"You had children?” Talia had never talked much about her\npast before. It was never really brought up, but the few times Blade had asked\nany personal questions she dismissed them.\n\n\"I do. Two handsome sons that have moved on from this city—a much better choice\nthan what I made.”\n\nBlade sensed a bit of longing in her voice. \"When was the last time you saw\nthem?”\n\nTalia sighed and picked at the armrests to her chair. \"Many decades ago,” she\nanswered, \"back when my first grandchild was born to my oldest. He and his wife\ndecided that this city wasn't safe to raise their hatchling in, and I couldn't\nhave agreed more. So they took a ship to one of the continents—I'm not sure\nreally where. My youngest stayed with me for several years after until he\ndecided the same, though he did try to get me to come with him.”\n\nTalia stared ahead, her pale-yellow eyes filled with thought. The light from the\nwindow caught her face, showing the age in her scales and how dull her green\nscales really were. Blade wondered how old she actually was, knowing that most\ntwo-legs lived half as long as ferals.\n\n\"Why did you stay?” Akir asked curiously.\n\n\"I was born and raised here... It is my home. People needed me here to tend to\nthem. But as time continued, I was needed less and less. You and Blade have been\nmy only patients in the last two years,” she said glumly. \"The city doesn't need\nme anymore, but I'm too old now to leave.”\n\n\"How old are you, Talia?” Blade asked.\n\nShe chuckled and shrugged her shoulders. \"Too old,” she answered. She pursed her\nlips and narrowed her eyes at them. \"You two should move on too... Find\nsomeplace else away from this godforsaken land.”\n\nAkir's embrace tightened around Blade, but he remained silent.\n\n\"I've thought about it,” Blade said and nuzzled his mate. \"But I haven't talked\nto Akir about it yet.”\n\nAkir looked away and made a grunt. He seemed to be thinking deeply about\nsomething that Blade couldn't place, which brought a little worry to his mind.\n\n\"If you can find a ship willing to carry ferals, do it,” Talia stated firmly.\n\"It may just be my bones getting old and jittery, but I feel like there is a\nstorm coming. A big one. Something that will cause a lot of chaos, and I'd hate\nto see you two get caught in the middle of it.”\n\n\"But what about you, Talia?” Blade asked worriedly. \"I don't want to leave you\nbehind.”\n\nShe smiled and shook her head. \"I'll be fine. If I die, then I die. No one will\nmiss me, and I've nothing left on this world.”\n\nBlade thought over her words and curled his tail with hers as he looked into her\neyes. \"I would miss you...”\n\n\"I would too,” Akir said kindly.\n\nTalia's face softened and she turned her head away. \"You two...”\n\nBlade placed a paw on her hand resting on the wooden arm of her chair. \"If we\nleave, you should come with us.” Blade had never seen Talia so close to crying\nbefore. He squeezed her hand and smiled widely at her.\n\n\"I'll think about it,” she said and chuckled.\n\nFor most of the evening, the three of them talked about how to raise a hatchling\nand what it would be like. The more they talked about it, the more Blade\nrealized how hard it will be to raise his own hatchling, but he knew it would be\nwell worth it.\n\nAkir seemed to mostly be in his own world, not saying much. Every time Blade\nlooked at him, he could see that he was still thinking about something. It made\nhim worry.\n\nAfter that, Blade and Akir took the egg to their room and made a little bed of\nfurs for it and set it down safe in a corner, wrapped in a warm cocoon. Then\nthey climbed onto their bed together and intimately cuddled.\n\nAkir curled up with Blade, pressing his underbelly against Blade's back. Warm\nscales rubbed against Blade's black and gold feathers as Akir hugged his mate,\nhis limbs wrapping around Blade's smaller body. Their tails twined together\nwhile their Blade's feathers melded into Akir's larger body.\n\n\"What are you worried about?” Blade asked and held one of Akir's paws.\n\nAkir was silent for a moment before he replied, \"Nothing, Blade. Everything is\nokay.”\n\n\"You can talk to me,” he pushed. He squeezed Akir's paw lovingly.\n\nAkir sighed and nuzzled into Blade's neck. \"It's fine... I've just been...\nthinking about our future together.”\n\n\"What about it?”\n\nAkir chuckled and nibbled on Blade's neck. \"Aren't you just full of questions?\nJust relax, Blade.”\n\nBlade dropped it for the moment and nodded, still feeling a little worried. But\nas they snuggled together, he started to forget about it. Akir's paw gently\ncaressed Blade's flank and underbelly, sifting through his soft feathers. Blade\nelicited a contented sigh, relaxing as he closed his eyes and leaned into Akir.\nAll of the excitement for the day trickled away, leaving Blade with a calm mind\nas he was wrapped in his mate's embrace.\n\n\"I love this, Akir,” he said. \"I love being with you. You make me feel... good.”\n\nBlade couldn't see the big, toothy smile that spread Akir's lips. \"I love being\nwith you too... more than else.”\n\nAkir licked the back of Blade's neck affectionately, grooming his feathers while\nhis paw rubbed him up and down. He squeezed Blade's tail and then started to\nplay with his hind paws with his own, their toes mingling and rubbing together.\n\n\"Do you think we'll always be like this?” Blade asked.\n\n\"Like what? Mates?”\n\nBlade nodded. \"Like... will we always have moments like this?”\n\nAkir kissed at Blade's cheek and chuckled. \"I think so, Blade. I don't see why\nnot. When we're older, we probably won't be mating as much though, if that's\nwhat you're worried about.”\n\nBlade giggled and shook his head. \"I'm not too worried about that... I just\nreally enjoy being with you.”\n\n\"I enjoy being with you too,” Akir replied.\n\nBlade purred softly while Akir's licks traveled around to the front of his neck.\nBlade stretched his neck out and exposed it to his mate, enjoying the sensual\nattention as the tongue doted his sensitive feathers. He chuckled quietly and\nrubbed his footpaws against Akir's, the soft, feathers on top of his paw rubbing\nagainst Akir's pawpads. His rump nestled in perfectly between Akir's hind legs,\nand Blade could feel the warmth of his mate's nethers pushing against his rear\nend.\n\nLusts riled up Blade's mind while he grinded his hind end between Akir's legs.\nAkir groaned softly and nipped at Blade's neck.\n\n\"Mmm... Someone is trying to get into some trouble,” Akir cooed. \"Talia might\nhear us, you know.”\n\nBlade hadn't really thought of that. \"Let's just be really quiet,” he said and\nsqueezed Akir's footpaw. He already felt his sheath stirring with his arousal.\nBeing so close and intimate with Akir brought many warm feelings flowing through\nhis body, and he could hardly resist the temptation.\n\nAkir purred delightedly in response and started to get friskier. His paw rubbed\nand caressed Blade's soft lower belly while his claws gently grazed through his\ngolden feathers. Blade cooed softly and nuzzled his mate lovingly. Akir chuckled\nand dipped his paw between Blade's hind legs.\n\n\"O-oh, Akir...” Blade gasped quietly and lifted his rear leg, inviting Akir's\nsensuous touch. His paw gripped and stroked Blade's squishy sheath up and down.\nArousal set in and warmed Blade's cheeks and loins while his flesh was\nstimulated. It stiffened inside his sheath as Akir groped it and coaxed it out.\n\n\"Let me feel your cock again,” Akir whispered into Blade's ear.\n\nBlade held back a moan and flexed his toes, squeezing Akir's toes as their\nfootpaws locked. Akir's paw touched and rubbed his growing spire. Akir cooed\nencouragingly to Blade as he stroked his cock up and down. Then he rubbed\nBlade's orbs in a circular motion before gently squeezing them and rolling them\nin his paw.\n\n\"Nngh... That feels g-good...”\n\nAkir gave Blade's cock a firm squeeze and slid his paw from the base of his\nshaft, up past his ridges, and to his tapered tip. \"You like that, cutie?” he\ncrooned.\n\nBlade blushed warmly and nodded, shuddering as pleasure coursed through him. He\nmoaned gently as Akir gripped his cock and rubbed it up and down repeatedly. His\nlength was soon hard and twitching within his mate's firm grasp.\n\nAkir's strokes continued as Blade groaned and grunted as quietly as he could.\nPleasure warmed his loins while his cock was rubbed from his tip to his sheath.\nThe strokes were slow at first. Akir rhythmically squeezed and massaged Blade's\nflesh from one end to the other, sending warm, blissful waves through him.\nAkir's paw was soft and gentle, and Blade could feel his pawpads rubbing against\nhis ridges and kneading into the base of his shaft.\n\nBlade relaxed and kept his legs splayed apart, giving his mate plenty of room to\npleasure him. He loved receiving attention like this from Akir. He stifled\nanother moan and flexed his toes while their hind paws were still locked,\nexpressing his pleasure. Akir's strokes gained speed, and Blade's dangling orbs\nwere soon bouncing back and forth between his legs while his mate worked his\ncock up and down quickly.\n\n\"Aaaah... A-Akir...” Blade could feel his mate's warm and erect flesh pushing\ninto his feathers as Akir grinded into his rump. His blush deepened as he\nthought about taking that cock again. He thought about the amazing feeling of\nhis mate's flesh burying deep into his rear, opening him up to fill him with his\nseed. Blade groaned quietly again as a deep blush set in his cheeks. He needed\nthat satisfaction!\n\nWhile Akir continued to jack him off, Blade lifted his rear leg higher and moved\ntheir twined tails over Akir's body to expose his tailhole to his mate. Akir was\nquick to move around and bring his hind end forward. His torso wrapped around\nBlade's while his hips pushed up against Blade's fluffy rump.\n\nBlade felt Akir's cock slipping and sliding around beneath his tail while his\nmate searched for his entrance. Blade shuddered when he found it, feeling the\nwarm tip of his cock pushing at his puckered muscles. Then he gasped and groaned\nas Akir pressed it into him, probably a bit too loudly. Akir's thick girth\nspread apart his rump while it forced its way through Blade's clenching muscles.\nBlade could feel his walls being pushed apart as his mate's large, smooth cock\nslid deeper inside him.\n\n\"That's it, Blade,” Akir cooed into his ear. \"Relax...”\n\nBlade's wings fluttered against Akir's belly as pleasure bloomed inside of him.\nIt was so hard to not moan out his pleasure when it was building so quickly\ninside him, wanting to burst free.\n\nAkir's cock stretched Blade's passage open, and Blade felt the pressure deep\ninside him building. As his mate continued to stroke his cock, Blade's orgasm\ndrew closer and closer. Pre was leaking from his tip and accumulating on Akir's\npaws, making his strokes slicker and smoother.\n\n\"Ooh, Akir... D-don't stop...”\n\nAkir purred deeply as he lay with Blade and started to pull his cock in and out\nof him. He humped Blade gently and slowly while holding him closely. Blade\ngasped and softly moaned his pleasure, feeling it all overwhelming his senses.\nHe panted heavily as lust brimmed inside his mind, ready to spill over.\n\nAkir's cock rubbed at the sensitive spot inside his passage, grinding and\ntugging against it. His paw gripped Blade's twitching, slick cock firmly while\nit quickly stroked it up and down. Soft paw pads rubbed against his ridged\nflesh, coaxing more and more pleasure from him with every up and down motion.\n\n\"I'm c-close...”\n\n\"Rwrrrr... that's it, Blade,” Akir moaned into Blade's ear. \"You're so warm and\nsoft... Mwrrr... You feel amazing. Cum for me, cutie.”\n\nBlade huffed as Akir licked and nibbled along his neck. His mate steadily humped\nhim, sliding his thick cock in and out of his rear. It rubbed against that\nblissful area inside Blade's rump, coaxing powerful waves of pleasure to flow\nthrough him. The bed lightly squeaked every so often, and Blade could faintly\nhear Akir patting against him.\n\nBut Blade couldn't hold off any longer, and he didn't care if Talia could hear\nthem. His feathers puffed out while he clenched and flexed his toes, feeling the\npressure building in his loins suddenly collapse under the waves of ecstasy.\n\nHe winced and gasped for breath as his cock erupted and spilled his seed in\nrapid bursts. It coated Akir's paw while it slid up and down Blade's throbbing\ncock. Strands of his semen sprayed onto his feathers and the bed. Blade's\nmuscles pulsed and tightened around Akir's flesh, massaging it as it continued\nto thrust in and out of him.\n\nBlade growled lowly as he was brought over the peak of pleasure. Akir continued\nto hump Blade relentlessly, their bodies rocking back and forth. Even after\nBlade had expended the last of his seed, Akir was still going, making him grunt\nwith every thrust as his sensitive passage was rubbed. Blade's muscles twitched\nand flexed around Akir's cock repeatedly.\n\nAkir moved his sticky paw to Blade's chest, gripping him and pulling him into\nmore of his thrusts while he worked toward his own orgasm. Blade didn't mind\nthat his feathers were soiled with his seed. He was too lost in the warm\nfeelings bathing his mind with pleasure.\n\n\"O-ooh... A-Akir...” Blade moaned softly to his mate. He closed his eyes,\nrelaxing in the pleasant feelings coursing through him. As the afterglow of his\nclimax washed over his body, Akir's cock was still sending pleasure tingling up\nhis spine. His sensitive passage continued to flex and clench around his mate's\nflesh, making Akir quietly growl and moan his lusts.\n\n\"Blade... t-turn onto your belly for me.”\n\nBlade obediently rolled onto his belly, and Akir moved with him, staying\nconnected at the hips. Blade blushed heatedly as Akir started to hump him harder\nand faster in the new position, reinvigorated. He lifted his tail for his mate\nand cooed to him encouragingly, eagerly taking his lustful thrusts. Now he could\ndefinitely hear Akir's crotch slapping against his rump while the bed squeaked\nmore loudly.\n\nAkir's belly now rested on top of Blade's back while his arms wrapped around\nBlade's underbelly. He pulled Blade against him as he thrust into him from\nbehind repeatedly. Blade's body rocked with his with every drive of his hips.\nAkir huffed and panted heavily while also moaning and grunting tenderly into\nBlade's ear.\n\nBlade had never felt pleasure like this before. Instead of all of the good\nfeelings gathering in one area inside of him, they spread out and warmed his\nentire body pleasantly. His toes curled, his wings shuffled, and his tail\ntwitched behind him. Every time Akir's cock slid in and out of him, he could\nfeel it rubbing and massaging his tight passage.\n\nAkir's body felt amazing when it pressed against Blade's back. It was as if he\ncould feel every powerful muscle of his working to mate him. His strong forearms\nsqueezed around his torso and pulled him into Akir's lap while his cock slid in\nand out of Blade's rump.\n\nAnd it felt amazing to let his mate use his body how he pleased. He knew Akir\nwas getting closer to his orgasm; he could tell from the rougher and more\nforceful thrusts that pounded against his rear. Blade relaxed and moaned\nencouragingly to Akir, wanting him to feel the same pleasure he had not long\nago.\n\nThen Akir suddenly growled out his lusts deep in his throat, slamming into\nBlade's rump and making his feathers flare out. Blade shuddered as he felt\nAkir's cock slide deep inside him, pulsing powerfully and filling his rear with\nhis warm essence. He could feel every throb of his mate's flesh pushing at his\nclenching walls, and he could feel that warm seed trickling deeper into his\npassage before oozing around Akir's length that was buried inside him\n\n\"A-Akir... Oooh...” Blade moaned softly to his mate while Akir grinded his hips\nagainst his, his cock rubbing and massaging him deeply while it spilled his\nseed. Blade could feel his slick, gooey liquid sloshing around inside his\npassage as Akir's cock moved.\n\nAkir huffed and licked Blade's ear, cooing and moaning into it as he rode out\nthe rest of his orgasm. \"I couldn't have asked for a more perfect mate,” he\nwhispered.\n\nBlade smiled happily and turned his head to nuzzle Akir affectionately. Akir\ngrunted softly and rubbed his snout with Blade's, having his moment in the\nafterglow while he hugged Blade tightly from behind.\n\nBlade loved being beneath Akir. He felt safer, more comfortable, and happy to\nhave his mate's warmth covering him. He could feel his sapphire-blue scales\nrubbing against the feathers of his back, and his broad, muscular chest that\npressed between his wings.\n\n\"Akir... Do you think Talia uhm... heard us?” Blade asked in a hushed voice,\nfeeling his cheeks flushing with warmth as he thought about the old dragonkin\nhearing them mating.\n\n\"Probably,” he replied and chuckled. \"We did get a little too loud.”\n\n\"Oh...”\n\n\"But she's already walked in on us before, so it's not like she isn't aware,” he\nadded.\n\nBlade gulped and nodded, but he felt immediately reassured as Akir hugged and\nsqueezed around him. He purred deeply in his throat and nuzzled under his mate's\nchin. He could still feel Akir's softening cock inside him while his muscles\ntwitched around it.\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Blade. Let's just get some rest.”\n\nBlade grunted as Akir pulled out of him and then turned onto his side to snuggle\nwith his mate. He relaxed while they cuddled and closed his eyes. Akir kissed\nhim lovingly and rumbled happily as they rested together for the night.\n\nThe next month couldn't have crawled by any slower for Blade. Every day, he and\nAkir would hold and nurture their egg and spend most of their time together with\nTalia. Blade was excited for the egg to hatch, and he could hardly keep from\nasking all sorts of questions—and most of them couldn't be answered. Even so,\nTalia was more than happy to share what she knew with both of them.\n\nA week or two later, Talia had finally found another home for her in the same\ntwo-leg district she lived in before. Blade and Akir helped her move and carried\nover all of the furniture they bought her before. They received plenty of looks\nand glares, and Blade was sure that some of the people there thought they were\nstealing, but thankfully nothing came of it.\n\nTalia seemed to be happy to be on her own again, though Blade and Akir still\nvisited her quite often. And now that she didn't live with them anymore, they\nhad plenty of opportunities to mate and pleasure each other. Blade loved it, and\nAkir did too, but they both knew it wouldn't be long before their egg hatched\nand they'd have to be secretive about it again.\n\nSo, they took every opportunity they could to enjoy their privacy while it\nlasted.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade purred with satisfaction as he licked his lips clean of his mate's seed,\nsmiling up at him while he lay back with his eyes closed and panting for breath.\n\n\"Ooh, Blade... That was wonderful,” Akir said. He sprawled out on his back and\nwriggled around happily with his paws clenching at the air. Blade cleaned Akir's\nsoft and drooping cock, swirling his tongue around it and slurping up his semen.\n\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed it,” he replied and soon finished tending to his mate.\n\"Can we go to the feral market now? I want to find some toys for our hatchling!”\n\nAkir chuckled and nodded. \"Just let me catch my breath first, sweetie. You might\nwant to sheathe your sword as well,” he teased.\n\nBlade blushed as he quickly glanced between his legs. Despite having had Akir\npleasure him first, he still managed to get a raging erection while he had\npleasured his mate. A small glob of pre formed at his tip while his length\ntwitched needily from between his legs.\n\n\"O-oh...” Blade had a hard time keeping his cock inside him when he was around\nAkir, so he had learned a few tricks to help keep it down. He put his two\nforepaws together and squeezed as tightly as he could while thinking about\nsomething he found.\n\nBefore too long they were both ready, so they left their home with some coin to\nspend—and made sure their egg was tucked away safely and cozily in their room.\n\nThe feral district felt much more like home to Blade, seeing how there were\nhardly and stuck-up two-legs here. Any two-legs that did come to this market\nwere just as poor as the ferals and had nowhere else to go. Everyone seemed to\nget along here, but it wasn't always the case.\n\nAkir never liked to admit it, but most ferals were haughty and aggressive when\ncompared to the two-legs. They'd fight over the simplest things like territory\nor food, but violence was widely accepted anyway as long as no one was seriously\ninjured.\n\nDespite all of that, it was still way better than the actual market district\ndeeper in the city. There wasn't as wide of a variety for goods, of course, but\nmost of the tattered and worn-down stalls carried merchandise and necessities\ncatering mostly to ferals.\n\nBlade and Akir walked side by side down the sandy and dirt road that cut between\nbuildings that were worn-down and half falling apart. They passed by dragons,\ngryphons, wolves, cats, and everything in between. Neither of the two was really\nknown here, aside from the little bit of infamy they had in the city, but they\ndid meet some friendly faces.\n\nBlade stopped at a stall that sold stuffed toys, thinking that maybe their\nhatchling would like a stuffed dragon to play with. Akir said that he'd look for\na cradle or something that Talia had mentioned at some point, to keep their\nhatchling cozy and safe in case they wanted to have some fun together,\nuninterrupted.\n\nBlade smiled as he talked with the gryphon merchant while he tried to find the\nperfect toy. He found a dark-blue dragon plushy that was made out of rags, but\nit still looked really nice. It didn't have any purple blotches, but Blade\nthought it resembled Akir in a sort of cute and adorable way. He bought it and\nput it in his satchel with a gleam in his eyes.\n\nAfter that, Blade wandered around, half-looking for Akir and half-looking for\nanother toy. Then he saw a public well not too far away—it was just down a small\nstreet. He felt a little parched, so he decided to go take a drink.\n\nSitting near the well were three male dragons, seeming to be basking in the\nsunlight. Blade smiled at them and tilted his head in greeting before dipping\nhis head into the well and taking a few gulps.\n\n\"That's ours,” the red one said. He stood up and sauntered over to Blade with\nhis wings slightly extended to make himself look bigger, though he was about the\nsame size as Blade—and probably the same age.\n\n\"Oh, s-sorry,” Blade said and wiped the water from his lips. \"I thought it was a\npublic well, and I-I was thirsty...” He backed away, not liking how the other\ntwo got up too. Blade tried to make himself as small and non-threatening as\npossible while he looked for an opportunity to get away.\n\nThe red sniffed at Blade as he stepped too close for comfort. Blade meeped and\npulled away as the drake smelled his neck. He heard a deep rumble in his throat\nas a small snarl formed at his lips.\n\n\"This one likes to lift his tail,” he said to his friends with a devious grin\nspreading his lips. Then he looked back at Blade with a hungry look in his eyes.\nDid he smell Akir's scent on him? Blade hadn't thought about that... He didn't\nbathe today either, and he and Akir had already mated once before their oral\nservicing with each other.\n\nBlade hadn't realized, but there was apparently a fourth member to their group:\na big male gryphon that stood behind him. He gulped, thinking that he got\nhimself into another bad situation.\n\n\"I-I'll be going n-now... Sorry for drinking your water,” he said and turned\naround, but a paw caught his tail and held him back.\n\n\"Where do ya think you're going, tail-raiser?”\n\nBlade yanked away and faced them as he backed up into a wall. He looked up and\nthought he could maybe escape by lunging into the sky, but he would just get\ncaught and dragged back down before he could get anywhere. Fear started to\nsettle in as he was surrounded. Where was Akir?\n\n\"I don't know what y-you want from me,” he stammered.\n\nThe orange and bronze dragon growled at him. \"Why don't you lift that tail for\nus?” he said. \"Haven't had a female wander around here for quite some time... We\ncould all use a little relief, and you'll have to do.”\n\nBlade's face flushed with an intense heat as he realized what they were meaning.\nHe shook his head vigorously and felt himself trembling. How could he fight off\nfour ferals at once? Were they really going to rape him?\n\nThen Akir landed behind them and roared loudly, sending chills down Blade's\nspine. He felt immensely relieved to see his mate here, and almost went bolting\ntowards him, but there were still four ferals surrounding him.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing!?” Akir growled and stamped his talons down as\nhe stormed toward them.\n\n\"B-Boss!?” one of them shouted in surprise, and then they all dispersed and fled\nthe scene with their tails tucked between their legs.\n\nBlade looked around and realized he was safe and ran to his mate. Akir hugged\nBlade tightly and enveloped him in his wings as he sat up on his haunches.\nBlade's wings quivered and his heart raced, but the whole ordeal was over before\nhe could even think about it.\n\n\"Are you okay, Blade?” Akir asked worriedly.\n\nBlade nodded and hugged Akir tightly back, nuzzling into his neck. All of his\nfears were vanquished now that his mate was here to save him. \"I'm okay.”\n\n\"Did they do anything to you?”\n\nBlade shook his head. \"You got here before they could.”\n\n\"Thank the gods... I shouldn't have left you.”\n\n\"I was fine, Akir,” Blade said and pulled away from the embrace to lick his mate\naffectionately. \"I guess I should just be more careful where I go... How did you\nscare them away like that?”\n\nAkir chuckled and bumped noses with Blade. \"I guess I'm just a scary dragon.”\n\n\"I don't think you're scary,” Blade replied with a grin. \"But one of them called\nyou boss?”\n\nAkir shrugged his wings. \"They must have had me confused for someone else... Did\nyou find a toy?”\n\nBlade nodded happily and took out the blue plush-dragon to show him. \"It looks\nlike you!”\n\n\"If I was deformed and had a stubby tail,” Akir retorted and chuckled as he\ninspected it.\n\nBlade grinned and put it back. \"Maybe, but I think he or she will love it.”\n\nAkir smiled back and nodded. \"I did find a crib, but I'll need your help to\ncarry it back. It's pretty large, but it should fit in our home.”\n\n\"Okay! Let's go then before they come back.”\n\nAkir and Blade returned home with their new wooden crib and had a rather\ndifficult time fitting it through the door, but they managed and set it up\nagainst the wall separating their room. Blade smiled and set down the plushy in\nit on top of a pile of furs they stuffed in there for the bedding.\n\nThen Akir set their egg safely into the pile of fur and put the toy next to it\nas he grinned toothily at Blade with an adoring look in his sapphire eyes. Blade\nnuzzled Akir and kissed him, locking maws with his mate. One thing quickly led\nto another, and Akir started to mount Blade, stepping over his smaller body.\n\nBlade huffed and pushed his hips up into Akir's lap and felt his mate's cock\nslide against his orbs and rub around his crotch. \"Mmm... We shouldn't in front\nof the egg,” Blade said.\n\nAkir licked up and down Blade's neck. He reached around to the front of Blade's\nbody too, licking under his chin and around the most sensitive places he could\nfind. \"It's still just an egg, Blade,” he chuckled. \"It's not like he or she can\nsee us.”\n\nBlade gasped softly and exposed his neck to his mate briefly before slipping out\nfrom under him and flagging his tail high into the air as he swaggered toward\ntheir bedroom. \"Maybe, but maybe he or she can hear us. Wouldn't that be awkward\nto explain when they first hatch?” Blade teased and watched Akir's hungry eyes\nfollow his rump.\n\nThey both stepped into the bedroom, but Akir didn't' waste hardly any time\nbefore he was mounting Blade again and pinning him down beneath his heavier\nweight. Blade cried out his bliss as Akir started to mate with him and submitted\nto him. He loved how their bodies melded and moved fluidly together, gently\nrocking back and forth. Each and every drive of Akir's hips would send pleasure\ntingling down Blade's spine and make his feathers fluff up and his crest flare\nout.\n\nAkir's thrusts gained more force the closer he was to orgasm, pounding against\nBlade's rear and jouncing him forward. It wasn't much longer before they both\nspent themselves. Their moans mixed together as each of them climaxed and felt\nthe peak of their arousal wash over them in ecstatic waves of pleasure.\n\nAfter that, they moved to their bed and cuddled intimately for another while,\nexpressing their love for each other physically.\n\n\"Do you think we'll have a male or female?” Blade asked and kissed at Akir's\nneck.\n\nAkir purred happily and pulled Blade's soft body against him. His paws sifted\nthrough Blade's feathers as he caressed him. \"I don't know, Blade... What are\nyou hoping for?”\n\nBlade thought about it for a moment and smiled thoughtfully. \"I really wouldn't\nmind either, but I guess a female would be nice. They don't seem as rowdy as\nmales are.”\n\nAkir chuckled and licked Blade's nose. \"But there will be plenty of other female\nrelated issues.”\n\n\"Like what?” Blade asked curiously.\n\n\"Lots and lots of drama,” Akir remarked. \"And then when she grows up, we'll have\nto worry about her getting a mate!”\n\nBlade grinned and nodded before burying his muzzle into Akir's neck. \"Do you\nthink we'll be good parents?”\n\nAkir squeezed Blade tightly and licked his forehead. \"I think so, Blade.”\n\nBlade purred happily and closed his eyes as warm relaxation settled in his body.\n\"I just hope he or she doesn't get confused about us...”\n\n\"What do you mean?”\n\n\"Well, you know... We're both males. Won't he or she wonder why we're\ndifferent?”\n\nAkir chuckled and nuzzled Blade reassuringly. \"It'll be fine, Blade. We'll just\nhave to introduce Vespera as their mother at some point.”\n\nBlade nodded and smiled. He nestled his head beneath Akir's chin, resting it on\nhis mate's neck with a contented sigh. This was everything he could have wanted\nand more.\n\n* * *\n\n\"O-oh... Akir...” Blade moaned as he lightly humped his mate beneath him, his\nhips patting against Akir's. \"Gods...”\n\n\"Mmmm... You feel wonderful, Blade. Keep going...” Akir grunted and panted\nunderneath Blade, taking his thrusts repeatedly while Blade built up his speed.\nBlade loved how warm and tight Akir felt around his cock. His flesh rubbed\nagainst his mate's soft passage as it slid in and out, drawing blissful moans\nfrom his lips. As good as Vespera had felt, he loved this more.\n\nIt felt strange to be the one on top, to be the one to dominate his mate. He\nliked the feeling of it: having power over his lover. It was the drives of his\nhips that brought them both pleasure, and it was him who was pinning Akir down\nand mating him, in control.\n\nAfter pounding against his mate for some time, it wasn't long before they were\nboth brought to the pinnacle of pleasure. Blade mashed his balls against Akir's\nrump as he came inside it, filling his mate with his seed. Akir's muscles\ntightened around Blade's throbbing muscle and pulsated with his own orgasm that\ndrizzled onto the floor below. Their moans mingled together until they had both\nsatisfied themselves.\n\nBlade pulled out of Akir with a messy schlick and flopped onto his back next to\nhim, his chest rising and falling rapidly while he panted for breath. Akir fell\nonto his side and did the same.\n\n\"That was wonderful, Akir,” Blade said once he caught his breath.\n\n\"It really was. Does my mate enjoy rutting me?” Akir cooed with a chuckle.\n\nBlade slid over to Akir and kissed him affectionately. \"I do!”\n\n\"Rwrrr... I'll admit that I do love feeling you inside me from time to time.”\nAkir kissed Blade back and lay a protective wing over him. Blade purred and\nsnuggled under that wing, elated.\n\nThen they heard a quiet thump on the other side of their bed. Both of their\nheads turned, and Akir was the first to get up and see what caused the noise.\n\n\"Blade... I think it's hatching,” Akir said with a mixture of surprise and hope.\nBlade was on his paws in an instant and rushed over to the egg with his mate. It\nhad rolled out of its nest and it was shaking and filling with tiny cracks.\n\n\"It's finally hatching,” Blade mumbled. He could hardly believe that the time\nhad finally come. After waiting for nearly two months, their hatchling was about\nto hatch. He wondered what it would look like, if it was a boy or a girl, if it\nwould like more like him or Vespera, and if it would recognize him or Akir as\nits father first.\n\nSoon enough, a black arm poked out of the shell, and then another black limb\nfollowed suit. Pieces of the egg broke off until a black head with stubby white\nhorns poked out and squeaked. Blade's heart wanted to leap out of his chest as\ntheir hatchling climbed out of the eggshell. He lowered his head close to the\nground, as did Akir, and cooed softly to the wobbly and squeaky little dragon.\n\nBlade noticed that it didn't have any male parts and smiled softly at her as she\nlooked around between him and Akir with wide, adorable, silver-blue eyes. Black\nfeathers puffed out in some places, but a lot of her soft body was still covered\nin the egg slime. Like Blade, she had a crest of feathers at the top of her head\nthat trailed down her neck, but they were silver instead of gold. She didn't\nhave much of a mane, but she had silver feathers that puffed out at the end of\nher tail. The rest of her body was a solid, ebony black color, as dark as the\nnight. Silver, swirly lines were etched into the feathers around her shoulder\nblades, extending up her wing joints.\n\n\"What are we going to name her?” Blade asked as she curiously sniffed at his\nsnout. He gave her a playful boop and giggled as she squeaked loudly.\n\nAkir smiled as he watched them. \"What was that name you liked? Tasha?”\n\n\"Asha,” Blade corrected. \"Do you like the name Asha?” he asked her. She just\nlooked at him with wide eyes and then went to inspect Akir.\n\nAkir chuckled and greeted her with a very gentle nuzzle. \"I think Asha is\nperfect.”\n\nAsha squeaked again and put a paw on Akir's muzzle, right on the tip of his\nnose. Akir grinned widely and flicked his tongue out at her, receiving another\nsqueak. Blade chuckled and fetched a cloth to help clean her up.\n\nHe carefully petted her with it, wiping away the slimy egg juices from her\nfeathers. Her black feathers puffed out after she was all dried off and clean.\nAsha wiggled and squirmed around while Blade tended to her, but she didn't\nreally protest since Akir was keeping her attention.\n\n\"I can't believe we have a hatchling of our own,” Blade said with a gleam of joy\nin his eyes.\n\nAkir nodded with a big, toothy grin, obviously feeling just as happy as Blade\nwas. \"She's perfect.”\n\nAsha wobbled around until she got the hang of walking while she curiously\ninspected every little thing that she could. Before she could find anything she\nshouldn't, Blade and Akir took her out of their bedroom and let her explore the\nliving area.\n\n\"Do you like your home, Asha?” Blade asked her as she came trotting back to\nthem. She looked up at Blade almost as if she recognized her name, but she\ndidn't respond. Blade gently picked her up and tucked her to his chest. Asha\nwriggled for a moment, and then a big yawn stretched her muzzle wide open,\nrevealing her tiny, razor-sharp teeth.\n\nAkir wrapped a wing around Blade and nuzzled their hatchling lovingly. \"She's\nalready tired,” he observed. \"Good thing we have her cradle set up already.”\n\nBlade shook his head. \"I want her to sleep with us for a while first.” He\nreached inside the cradle and took out the dark-blue plushy. Asha accepted it\nwith what Blade thought was a happy squeak because she clumsily held it and\nexamined it.\n\nAkir smiled and nodded, giving Blade a quick kiss on the cheek. \"Sounds like a\ngood idea, cutie.”\n\nBlade's eyes met Akir's for a moment. His heart fluttered with elation as Akir's\njoyous expression looked back at Blade. They kissed each other before Asha let\nout another squeak. Blade giggled and hugged her.\n\n\"I'll go take a quick nap with her,” Blade said.\n\n\"I'll join you two.”\n\n\n\n\n\nVespera came to visit them a few days later, after Akir had told her their egg\nhad hatched. She was absolutely thrilled to see Asha. Blade saw that motherly\nlook in her eyes and wished that Vespera didn't have to be separated from her\ndaughter, but it was what they all agreed on. Asha was very friendly with\nVespera, too, giving the same curiosity that she did to Blade and Akir. He\nwondered if she knew that Vespera was her mother.\n\nAfter that week had passed, when Blade felt that it was safe enough, they took\nAsha to visit Talia. They took to the streets instead of the skies, wanting to\nlet Asha explore a little bit. But instead of exploring, Asha clung very closely\nto Blade—to the point that he had to hold her most of the way. She seemed\nfrightened about all the sights, smells, noises, and even the wind that would\nkick up some sand. She really didn't seem to like the sand.\n\nTalia was very happy to receive visitors, especially a cute and fluffy hatchling\nlike Asha. She was glad to see Blade and Akir too.\n\nAsha was very curious about Talia at first. She looked similar to the other\ndragons she had seen, but she walked on two legs instead of four. Still, it\nwasn't long before Asha was comfortable enough to curl up on Talia's lap and\ntake a nap.\n\n\"She's very cute,” Talia said, stroking Asha's soft feathers.\n\nBlade nodded with a smile. \"She takes after me!” Akir and Talia both chuckled.\n\n\"I think I'm rubbing off on him,” Akir teased, giving Blade a firm nuzzle.\n\nBlade giggled and bared a toothy grin. Then he glanced around Talia's new home,\nrealizing that it was much more furnished than the last time he and Akir\nvisited.\n\n\"How do you like your new home?” Blade asked her.\n\nTalia's new home was much smaller than her old one, and it was made out of\nsandstone like most of the other buildings around. Despite that, she still\ndidn't have many belongings, so it wasn't as cramped as what her old house had\nbeen. But Blade knew that it was only a matter of time before Talia would have\neverything she could possibly fit in here.\n\n\"It's wonderful, really. My legs have really been thanking me, since everything\nis so close together. It was a pain to walk on those old, rotting planks back\nand forth every time I needed something.”\n\n\"Have you had any trouble since you moved?” Akir asked and narrowed his eyes.\n\nTalia shook her head. \"Not at all. This neighborhood is a lot nicer than my old\none, too. I've actually made a few friends. Won't be much longer before I start\noffering my healing services again!”\n\nBlade smiled, happy to see Talia enjoying her new home.\n\nThey sat around and chatted for another while before Asha woke up and started to\ncomplain with whines and squeaks. Blade tried his best to calm her, but he and\nAkir ended up leaving to go get the three of them some food.\n\nWhen that was done, they returned home and settled in for the night. Blade and\nAkir let Asha sleep in her crib for the first time, since she fell asleep rather\nquickly. They snuck into their bedroom together and quietly mated, sharing their\nlove for each other while they had the chance."
