They were on their way to see Vespera to explain that Akir\nwas no longer interested in her. The plan was not to mention that he found\nanother mate, and they especially weren't going to mention who that other mate\nwas!</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shrugged his purple wings. \"It's been a week since I\nlast saw her. She's probably moved on already.\" Akir took a sharp turn to the\nright, his head darting back and forth in search of her home. They were deep inside\nthe feral district where housing complexes smashed together tightly, leaving no\nroom at all between them. It was a very cramped area, and it was particularly\ndifficult for ferals to walk through the narrow street since most of them were\nrather big when compared to the two-legs. They had to squeeze past several\nothers to make their way down the path.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You think so? Sounds like you shouldn't have mated with her\nanyway,\" Blade snapped with a sly grin.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and poked Blade with a tail. \"Still jealous,\nhuh?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and shook his head. \"Not anymore!\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Good. I can't have my mate still being jealous when we've\nbeen together for almost a week already.\" Akir nuzzled his neck and nipped at\nhis jaw.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed deeply and grinned, thinking about what Akir\nsaid earlier that day when they were out shopping for furniture. \"I'm really\nanxious to... mate with you again tonight, especially now that we have the new\nbed,\" he admitted. \"I've been thinking about it all day.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and smiled toothily at Blade. \"I've noticed!\"\nhe teased as his eyes peered beneath Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade meeped and blushed even hotter as he looked down.\n\"Have I...?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nodded. \"You must really like mating with me, Blade.\nWe've done it every night so far, and you still keep getting erections in\npublic.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stammered and flushed heatedly. \"I didn't think anyone\nn- noticed...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm probably not the only one,\" Akir teased and giggled as\nBlade's feathers poofed out.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why didn't you tell me?\" Blade whined, horrified and\nembarrassed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"'Cause it's cute. And it looks like we're here,\" he said\nand pointed at the second story to the front of a hovel with some common runes\ncarved into the stone next to the door. Blade didn't know what they read, but\nAkir seemed to.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The buildings weren't all that high; Blade estimated about\nfive or six stories, and they were built like staircases, one floor like a step\nto the next. They hopped up to the second story platform and knocked carefully\non the door. It looked like the door was about to fall off.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What if she's not home?\" Blade asked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Then we'll find her or come back tomorrow.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What if she gets really angry?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Then we'll just leave.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and continued, \"What if&#8212;\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade!\" Akir scolded and nipped Blade. \"Relax.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shuffled around on his paws and refolded his wings.\n\"O- Okay, sorry.\" He didn't know why, but he was feeling very nervous! Normally\nwhen he was around Akir, his confidence tended to rub off on Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head disapprovingly with a small grin.\n\"You're ridiculous sometimes.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then the door creaked open and Vespera poked her black head\nout. A big, toothy smile immediately spread her lips as she swung the door the\nrest of the way open and invited them inside.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Akir! Blade! It's good to see you! This is quite the\nsurprise. I never imagined that you'd show up with Blade this time. Have\nsomething planned for the three of us?\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade never understood why Akir had fallen for her. She was\na chatterbox, and her voice was a bit annoying... It was to Blade, at least. He\nbared a small, friendly smile anyway and stepped inside after Akir. It smelled\nof feral, female dragon inside; her scent filled the tiny space, and it tickled\nBlade's nostrils. He wasn't used to that sort of aroma at all; it made him feel\na little tingly. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Her home was just one room, having everything she needed\nsurrounding them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"No, nothing like that,\" Akir explained with a chuckle.\n\"Blade is much too shy.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shot him an uncertain glance. Was there something he\nmissed?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, I see. That's a shame. You're a very handsome dragon\ntoo, and I'd love to mess up your feathers,\" she chirred to Blade. Blade shrunk\nback a little with a small smile, wanting to hide behind Akir. \"So what brings\nyou here then? Are we going somewhere? What about food? I'm hungry!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. She was\nlike this when he had first met her too. Even if she was nice, he could hardly\nstand her. Maybe he wasn't actually jealous of her and just disliked her\ninstead.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head and looked at her seriously. \"I need to\ntalk to you about something rather important.\" Then he glanced back at Blade\nand gestured to the door with a wing. \"Alone, if you don't mind, Blade.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and dipped his head politely before slipping\nout the door. He stood out in the glaring sun, feeling it warming his feathers\ndelightfully. The skies were clear with a deep blue hue, making Blade wonder\nbriefly if there was an ocean way up there where he couldn't fly. He felt much\nbetter out here than in that stuffy room with that blabbermouth. Still, he\ncouldn't help but to feel a little curious about what Vespera's reaction would\nbe. He pressed his ear to the door and tried to listen in.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"&#8212;that would be best for the both of us,\" Akir finished.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It was rather hard to hear Vespera's higher pitched voice,\nbut he could faintly make out her words. \"I can't believe you're already\nleaving me... I thought we were good together! I really enjoyed mating with you.\nAnd you liked it too! Why don't you want to anymore? Is there someone else?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A long pause.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I do like you Vespera. You're very nice and all, but there\nis someone else.\" Blade gulped. He said he wouldn't tell her! </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Who is it?\" Vespera half-growled. \"She better not be\nprettier than me.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Well, she's not a she.\" Akir wasn't following the plan...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed but relaxed a little. He chuckled, imagining\nhow stunned Vespera must be right now. He bet that she'd never imagine that\nAkir liked males!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, so you finally convinced Blade to mate with you? That\nwas kind of fast. How'd you seduce him? Was it easy? Was it as good as you'd\nthought it&#8212;\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's jaw dropped and he pulled his ear away. She knew!?\nAnd Akir planned on seducing Blade? Blade felt his stomach turn unpleasantly as\nhis chest ached.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Did Akir even care about being his mate? Had he just wanted\nBlade to satisfy his lusts? He stared at the door and felt himself wanting to\ncry. He backed away until he nearly slipped off the small platform. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He knew Akir better than that. He wouldn't ever do something\nlike that to Blade. And what he said that night they mated... that had been real,\nright? Was it something he meant and not just something he said to make Blade\nfeel happy? They had loved each other since they were little, like siblings,\nbut did Akir really love Blade like a mate? Why would Akir not tell him? Blade\nshook his aching head and took off. He needed to clear his mind. He flew to the\nonly other home he knew: Talia's house.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nearly burst through Talia's door when she opened it.\nHe shoved right past her and then sniffled as he started to cry. He let loose\nall of the emotions churning inside him and lay on his belly while covering his\nhead with his paws. He couldn't stop thinking that Akir had just used him, no\nmatter how much he tried to believe otherwise. He felt Talia kneeling down\nbeside him and patting his shoulders between his wings.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What's wrong, Blade?\" she asked worriedly. Having a sobbing\ndragon burst through your door must be quite the surprise!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gritted his teeth. Talia didn't know that he and Akir\nwere mates now. He meant to tell her soon, but this was the first time he had\nseen her in a month. \"A- Akir...\" he mumbled.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Where is he?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head and whimpered. \"He is th- the problem.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He could almost feel Talia tense up. \"What'd he do?\" she\nhissed. \"Did he hurt you?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade quickly shook his head again, not wanting her to lash\nout at Akir. \"No! It's s- something else...\" He wiped his tears away and looked\nat Talia. He recollected himself the best he could, taking a deep breath.\n\"It'll take some explanation...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She grinned softly at him and sat down beside him\ncross-legged. \"I'm all ears.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade then proceeded to explain their recent events... in as little\nof detail as possible. He told her about Vespera, how he was jealous of her,\nhow him and Akir then mated, and then about how happy he was being his mate\nuntil today.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"She made it sound like he was only interested in mating\nwith me,\" he finished.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"And is it true?\" Blade was surprised that she didn't react\nmuch to him and Akir being mates. Maybe it was a normal thing after all!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrugged his wings and sniffled. \"I- I don't think\nso...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia chuckled. \"So, you got yourself all worked up when you\ndon't even know what really happened?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade looked at her, and his mouth moved as if he wanted to\nspeak, but he couldn't find the words. He shook his head and stared at the\nfloor, his ears drooping. He clawed a rut in a plank of wood. He knew he had\nacted hasty, and he let his emotions get the better of him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, Blade... Sometimes, I think you're just as dull as he is.\nAkir is probably worried to death about you right now.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You th- think so?\" He felt rather foolish for thinking that\nAkir used him, and it frustrated him that he had to come to Talia for him to\nrealize that. But he was glad he did. He knew now without a shadow of doubt\nthat Akir loved him. Whatever Vespera had said must have been something else\nentirely!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia nodded and smiled softly at him. \"I never thought you\ntwo would become mates, but I'm very happy for you both. I know how much you\nlove Akir.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade smiled happily and wiped away his remaining tears. \"He\nmakes me really happy... And I think I make him happy too.\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia's eyes swirled with memories that passed before her\neyes. Blade could see how she reminisced about something she held close to her\nheart. It made him want to ask about it, but she stopped him. \"You better get\ngoing, Blade. Akir might tear down the city looking for you!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and stood up. He gave her an affectionate\nnuzzle and left. \"Thanks, Talia!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He leapt to the sky and saw that the blazing sun was still\nhigh in the clear sky. He angled his wings and turned toward their home. He\nhoped that Akir wasn't angry with him for leaving so suddenly. He could only\nimagine how worried he must be, especially after the last time Blade went\nmissing. Blade sighed and sped forward. He knew he was going to be in trouble!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade opened the door to their home and peaked in, expecting\nto see Akir waiting for him with an angry look on his face. But there wasn't a\nblue and purple dragon in sight. He sighed with relief, glad to not be scolded\njust after returning home. He stepped inside and lay down on their old bedding\nthat they moved to the middle of the main room. He waited for Akir to return,\nbut as an hour slowly passed, a gnawing feeling clawed at his stomach.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He knew Akir was probably out looking for him, worried to\ndeath. He wished he could leave to look for Akir himself, but if he did, then\nthe chances of Akir finding him soon were even slimmer&#8212;plus, he could return\nany minute. He had to wait and accept Akir's wrath when he returned. He only\never got angry when Blade did something foolish that made him concerned, and\nthis would certainly be one of those times. Blade curled up and rested his head\non his tail, waiting in silence.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When the door creaked open, Blade's head shot up. He had\nfallen asleep while waiting for Akir, and he saw that it was dark out now. His\nheart nearly stopped in his chest while his head swirled with guilty thoughts.\nAkir had been out looking for him for hours while he napped! As soon as his\neyes met Akir's, he expected to see a malevolent storm brewing in the twin\nsapphires... but he couldn't really place what he saw.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade...\" Akir rushed over to him and practically fell on top\nof him. He wrapped his limbs around Blade, squeezing him tight while his wings\nenveloped him like a warm blanket. Blade squeaked as he was squeezed almost too\ntight! His feathers fluffed up as Akir buried his snout into Blade's neck. He\ncould feel Akir's limbs trembling as if they were too exhausted to continue\nhugging him, but Akir persisted until Blade heard a quiet whimper and felt warm\ntears drip onto his feathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's heart nearly shattered. He clenched his teeth\ntightly and embraced Akir back. He had prepared himself for a bloodbath, but he\ndid not prepare himself for this...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I- I'm so s- sorry, Akir,\" he sobbed. How could he ever\nhave thought Akir didn't care about him? </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You st- stupid, feathered id- idiot!\" he sputtered. Blade\ncould tell that Akir was trying to regain his composure, but he was failing;\nBlade could see right through him. His normally strong composure was crushed.\n\"I looked everywhere for you...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir wasn't dumb. He had probably checked their home first\nbefore Blade had returned. After that, he probably searched every street,\nalley, and yard for Blade until he couldn't anymore. Akir was exhausted and\nBlade could feel his heart thudding heavily and quickly inside his chest. He\nwas breathing hard, too.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm sorry,\" Blade repeated and squeezed Akir while pulling\nhim snugly against his soft body, acting like a pillow for his mate. He cried\nand tears streamed down his cheeks. Akir was sniffling too, in a constant\nbattle to stop crying. They continued like this for a few minutes, the both of\nthem letting their pent up emotions seep from them. Blade felt guilty and Akir\nwas relieved.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I thought something bad happened again... I thought I had\nlost you,\" Akir mumbled and pulled Blade tightly against him as Blade turned\nonto his back. Blade wrapped his arms and wings around Akir, hugging him\nequally as tight.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head and buried his muzzle in Akir's\nshoulder. \"I was being d- dumb,\" he said. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Where did you go?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Talia's...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why?\" he pressed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He didn't really want to tell Akir why&#8212;he felt very foolish\nabout it&#8212;but he knew he had to. \"I th- thought that you didn't really love me\nlike a mate.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir pulled away and looked at Blade in genuine shock. \"Why\nwould you ever think that?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sniffed and avoided meeting his eyes. \"I overheard\nVespera talking... a- about how you told her that you planned on mating with me.\nShe made it sound like you d- didn't care about me...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's expressions softened as an amused grin curled his\nlips. \"Blade... You got all worked up over that?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade winced and nodded. Talia had asked the same thing! He\nknew he overreacted... by a lot. Had he just sat there and waited for Akir, he\ncould have avoided this whole situation.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and wiped Blade's tears away. \"You didn't hear\nwhat I said after that, did you?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head and looked up at Akir curiously. He\ndidn't seem as upset as he had expected him to be. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">They were lying together, belly to belly, and half-mindedly\ncuddling. Blade's forepaws stroked down Akir's flanks as a blush warmed his\ncheeks. He realized how foolish he really was as he looked into Akir's eyes. He\nhad a hard time believing that he was actually Akir's mate. It felt like\nnothing really changed between them, but cuddling intimately with him now\nbrought a new light to his eyes. They never did this before, and it felt very\nwarming and relaxing. It felt good to <i>feel</i>\nloved.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Good, 'cause I'm not going to tell you,\" he teased with a\nbig grin.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and nuzzled Akir. \"Tell me!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head. \"No... It's too sappy.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Sappy?\" A playful grin spread Blade's lips. \"That's not\nlike you.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I know, that's why I won't repeat it!\" He nipped at Blade's\nneck and affectionately licked him. A long moment of silence passed as Akir\nseemed to be deep in thought.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Just know that I love you, Blade, with all of my heart.

I think I always have.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade almost melted in Akir's arms as he held him closely\nand tenderly doted him. \"I feel the same about you, Akir,\" Blade said with a\ntoothy smile. \"I love you, and I won't ever do that to you again.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's sapphire gems sparkled with delight, unmistakably\nexpressing the joy he found in Blade's words. He warbled softly and nuzzled\nBlade's neck, soon burying his muzzle in Blade's feathers. \"As long as you're\nsafe, I don't care, Blade.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So, you're not mad then?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A soft smile parted Akir's lips. \"How could I be with a face\nlike that?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grinned happily and giggled as Akir licked his face,\nfeeling his wet, slimy tongue against his smaller, prickly feathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Just don't run off on me like that,\" Akir said and licked\nbetween Blade's white horns.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and hugged Akir snugly. He thought about how mates would act, so he\ngently caressed Akir's scales, his paws tracing up and down his flank. Akir\ncooed softly to Blade and did the same to him while sensually nibbling and\nlicking his neck up to his chin. Blade sighed and relaxed as he exposed his\nneck to Akir, feeling much better already. Their tails twined together and\nswayed back and forth while they cuddled intimately.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Heat flushed Blade's cheeks as he focused on all the\npleasant feelings coursing through him. He lay back as Akir's belly pressed\nagainst his, and then a quiet moan escaped his lips as he felt Akir's warm\nnethers mashing against his. He gasped and suddenly felt his loins warming with\narousal while their bodies melded together, scales against feathers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"A- Akir...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why don't we go try out our new bed?\" Akir cooed as he\ngrinded firmly against Blade. \"You've been waiting all day for this.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade looked up at him and nodded eagerly, so they separated\nfor the moment, stood up, and slipped behind their drapes into their bedroom.\nInstead of the pile of bedding they had before, there was now a solid, large\nbed built for two dragons scooted up against the wall.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stepped up onto it first and flopped lazily down,\nbouncing slightly against the cushiony material. The bed slightly dipped\nbeneath his weight, and it dipped only slightly more when Akir joined him.\nBlade rolled onto his back as Akir lay on top of him, resuming their previous\nposition as they snuggled together.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade warbled happily and nuzzled Akir, feeling much more\ncomfortable now that there was cushion against his back. Akir grinned down at\nhim and then started to lick and nuzzle beneath his chin. Blade gasped softly\nand held Akir closely. He gripped his flanks between his thighs and wrapped his\narms and wings around his back. Their hips met and fit together perfectly as\ntheir tails entwined behind them. Their sheaths touched while their balls\nrubbed and molded together.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir doted Blade's neck affectionately, licking and nibbling\nup and down it while his firm body sensually grinded against Blade's. A soft\nmoan escaped Blade's open mouth as he breathed in deep breaths, feeling his\narousal quickly stirring his senses. His forepaws traced Akir's muscles,\nrubbing and caressing them while they explored his scaled body. Blade had\nalways enjoyed the feeling of scales and often wondered what they would feel\nlike instead of feathers covering his body. They felt so smooth against his paw\npads, and Akir's were very pretty.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir seemed to wonder the same about Blade's feathers. His\npaws sifted through the soft fluff around Blade's shoulders and down his\nflanks, feeling and exploring him. That made Blade wiggle and shudder with\ndelight until he moaned again and felt his exposed flesh starting to rub\nagainst Akir's swelling sheath. Akir cooed and looked between their legs.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Is that what I think it is, cutie?\" he teased and rubbed\nagainst Blade's firm sheath with his own. Blade flexed his toes as he felt\ntheir balls mashing together and their cocks touching. Their exposed tips\nrubbed together while each of them was aroused. Blade stole a peek as his wings\ndropped to his sides, seeing Akir's flesh touching his own. It was warm,\nsmooth, and slick. Pre mixed and collected along their shafts as both of their\nerections grew and rubbed together. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade panted lightly and groaned with lust while he let Akir\narouse him. He lay back, blushing warmly as Akir doted his neck and pushed\ntheir hips together. Pleasant thoughts and feelings swam inside Blade's head,\nurging him to grind against his mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I- I love mating with you,\" Blade said with sincerity,\nlooking up into Akir's eyes. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled down at him, a toothy grin curling his lips.\n\"Does it feel good?\" he asked as his forepaw started to grope his and Blade's\ncocks, rubbing them together. That was a favorite of Blade's; it made his toes\ncurl while he gasped with delight. To feel Akir's sensitive organ against his\nown made him shudder.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Y- Yes... very good.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Good.\" Akir lowered his muzzle to Blade's and licked his\nlips lovingly. Blade cooed and parted his lips to lick back at Akir's tongue.\nThey shared their saliva while their tongues mingled together, and then Akir\npressed his lips firmly to Blade's. His tongue slipped inside Blade's mouth,\nmaking Blade's cheeks flush intensely as they kissed. His eyes bulged as he\nsucked in a quick breath.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Kissing like this was a rare sign of affection to dragons.\nMost mates would wait until they had eggs together to even attempt kissing. It\nheld a deep, heartfelt meaning that most often signified mateship for life.\nBlade could hardly contain his excitement!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's heart thudded deeply and rapidly in his chest as he\nmelted in the affection. He closed his eyes, losing himself almost immediately.\nThey mouthed at each other, their lips touching while their tongues explored\neach other's maws. Blade's wings fluttered and rubbed against Akir's as their\nwoven tails swayed from one side of the bed to the other. Akir stopped\neverything else he was doing and delved deep into their passionate kiss. Their\ntongues wrestled and twined while their breaths were ragged. Blade softly held\nthe back of Akir's head while turning and twisting his own impulsively to get\nall of the good angles. The feelings of adoration that ignited his heart were\nunlike anything he had felt before, and he could share it all with his Akir...\nhis mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When they finally separated, their eyes met, blue and gold.\nThey were both speechless and breathing hard with soft grins at their lips.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade placed a paw on Akir's chest and half-mindedly felt\naround his firm muscles there. \"That... That was amazing, Akir,\" he said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nuzzled Blade tenderly and kissed him again, wanting\nanother taste. Blade lightly pushed and caressed Akir's chest while cocking his\nhead sideways and suckling on his tongue. This was like a dream come true to\nhim. His body was the warmest and most relaxed it ever had been while he could\nfeel the deep pounding of his heart echoing throughout.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">This kiss was much shorter than the last, and it ended when\nAkir flipped onto his back. They switched positions, and Blade was now on top,\nlooking down at Akir. His eyes lingered on his smooth cock before he pressed\ntheir hips together and replicated what Akir did to him, grinding and rubbing\ntheir nethers together.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Take me, Blade,\" Akir half-whispered. \"Mate with me.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A confused expression crossed Blade's face. \"You want me\nto...\" Blade had always been the bottom; he was always the one to take Akir's\ncock, never the other way around.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and nodded. \"I want you to feel that pleasure\ntoo.\" He spread his legs wide and presented himself to Blade. Blade blushed\nwarmly as lust and excitement welled within him. He backed up a bit as he sat\nupright and stared between Akir's legs.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Between his muscular thighs was his twitching cock and his\ndrooping package beneath it. And below his dangling stones was his tailhole.\nAkir didn't seem to mind that Blade was more curious than anything&#8212;he never\nreally had much of a chance like this with Akir before. Blade reached down with\nhis soft, fuzzy forepaws and felt Akir's cock. He stroked it up and down and\nfelt the thick rod of meat that he had enjoyed on several previous occasions.\nIt twitched and pulsed in his grasp as a drizzle of pre oozed out of the tip.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, Blade,\" Akir moaned as he flexed his toes. Blade smiled\nand rubbed Akir's length a few more times before groping and squeezing his\nstones. That received him a pleasured coo from Akir. Excitement coursed through\nBlade as he felt Akir's nethers, rubbing and fondling them curiously. Even\nthough Akir had scales, his balls felt almost as soft as Blade's. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then Blade decided to leave more of his exploration for\nlater as his lust urged him on. He scooted up again and pressed the tip of his\ncock firmly against Akir's tail base. He lined it up with his tailhole,\nwatching as he guided it into his mate, like Akir had a few times before with\nBlade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sucked in a deep breath as he felt his flesh penetrate\nAkir's rear. It slipped inside easier than he thought it would and was greeted\nby warm, soft muscles squeezing around it. Akir gasped and moaned Blade's name\nencouragingly. Blade's cock slid inside Akir deeper, spreading his tight ring\nof flesh apart as each ridge on the underside of his shaft slipped inside.\nBlade had never felt anything so warm and soft around his cock before. Akir's\nmaw had been one thing, but this felt utterly amazing. His sheath firmly\npressed against his mate's entrance, his cock enveloped completely in Akir's\ntight passage.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"A- Akir... you feel so... amazing.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled at Blade and wrapped his legs around him. His\nthighs gripped Blade's flanks while his forepaws stroked the golden mane along\nhis back. \"Your cock feels amazing, too,\" he cooed softly into Blade's ear.\nThat made Blade shudder with delight, especially when Akir squeezed his flesh\nwith his muscles.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade was already panting as he hilted Akir. He had no idea\nhow long he would last, and he wanted to last long enough for Akir, but he\ncouldn't wait to feel that pleasure of taking his mate. He withdrew slowly,\ngasping and moaning as his ridges tugged against Akir's walls. He pulled his\ncock out until only the tip remained, and then he pushed quickly back in. He\nshuddered and hung his head. Drizzles of his pre escaped his tip and spilled\ninto Akir's passage, helping to lubricate his penetrating flesh. Blade repeated\nthe motion again and again until he finally had a steady pattern. He humped Akir\ngently, softly moaning his name while he did.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade watched Akir's reactions intently, wanting to please\nhis mate more than anything. Akir's eyes were sewn tightly shut while his maw\nwas parted. He panted just like Blade did, and the occasional grunt escaped his\nlips. Blade's length slid in and out of his tailhole repeatedly, rubbing and\nspreading apart his tight walls. Their hips gently patted together while their\nbodies rocked in unison. Akir held Blade closely, wrapping his limbs around him\nwhile eliciting his pleasure.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir's cock twitched and bounced beneath him, catching\nBlade's eye. He saw a small pool of pre building on Akir's scales while string\noozed from his tapered tip. Blade had never imagined lusting for a cock before\nthey became mates, but now it was all he could think about. He reached a paw\ndown, leaving the other planted firmly on the bed to keep his balance. He\ngripped Akir's length as it pulsed within his grasp and started to stroke him\nup and down, sliding his soft paw from the tip of his flesh to the thicker\nbase.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh wow... Blade...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir moaned loudly and squirmed beneath Blade as he\npleasured him in two places at once. Blade continued to steadily hump Akir\nwhile pawing him off. Akir's muscles quivered around Blade's length in time\nwith the light throbs of his slick member.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade felt Akir's hard, warm cock, squeezing it in his\ngrasp. His grip slid smoothly up and down, lubricated by pre and natural\nsecretions that made it easier to mate. Feeling Akir's sensitive organ was\nexciting to Blade. He thoroughly enjoyed hearing Akir's encouraging moans as he\nstroked his mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Nngh... that feels so good...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade couldn't have asked for a more perfect position to be\nin with Akir. He loved every second of it, being able to give pleasure while\nalso receiving it. It was the most intimate mating they had done yet. Their\nbodies pressed together, belly to belly, while Blade humped and stroked Akir.\nAnd he loved how he could watch Akir's expressions churn. His head lightly\nbobbed back and forth while his body swayed with Blade's. He would wince and\nmoan and gasp all the while Blade thrust in and out of him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">As Blade mated Akir, his speed started to pick up. He could\nhardly contain himself as pleasure and lust warmed his loins immensely.\nReluctantly, he took his paw away from Akir's cock, using it for balance as his\nclaws dug into their bed. He drove his hips into his mate's harder and faster\nas his instincts fogged his mind.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Having Akir's walls rubbing against every angle of his\nsensitive flesh sent the back of Blade's skull blooming with bliss. It wasn't\nlong before their hips were meeting with wet smacks. Blade's pre lubricated his\nlength enough that he could quickly slip in and out of Akir's warm, clenching\npassage.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, Blade... d- don't stop...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade moaned back at Akir, refusing to ever stop as long as\nhis mate was enjoying this. He could feel Akir's body reacting each time he\nhilted him, feeling his muscles twitch inside and out. Akir's thighs held\nBlade's flanks tightly as Blade pushed him into the bed with every thrust. The\nbed creaked as their bodies moved together in unison, but the annoying\nsqueaking was drowned out by their constant moans and humping.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Aah!\" he moaned. \"B- Blade... Yesss...\" Blade blushed deeply as\nhe heard Akir's sultry voice. And then a moment later, Akir's muscles tightened\nand flexed around Blade's cock, clenching him tightly while they pulsated\nrapidly. Blade didn't know quite what was going on as Akir writhed around on\nhis back, but then he felt warm, gooey liquid spraying into his belly feathers.\nBlade looked down as he rolled his hips into Akir's and saw his cock throbbing\nand spilling copious ropes of his seed, making a mess on both of their bellies.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's moans joined Akir's as he redoubled his efforts,\nfeeling even closer to an orgasm now. He was surprised Akir finished before he\ndid, but that must have meant that he did well! Akir's body moved with Blade's,\nsliding back and forth across the bed as Blade pounded against him. He buried\nhis warm face into Akir's chest, panting heavily and moaning between gasps\nuntil he finally felt it all release.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He elicited a lewd groan as he shoved his length as deep as\nhe could into Akir's rear. He climaxed, his cock pulsing and throbbing rapidly\nas his warm seed filled Akir's passage. He could feel it spilling and oozing\naround his cock as he held himself deep inside Akir's rump.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nuzzled Blade lovingly and pressed their foreheads\ntogether while moaning to him encouragingly. \"That's it, Blade... Ooh!\" Blade\ncould hardly make sense of anything. He lost himself in the blissful pleasure\nthat claimed his body. His muscles froze in place as Akir held him and cooed\nwhile rubbing his body. Rope after rope of Blade's seed ejaculated into Akir's\ntight, quivering passage, lasting for what felt like forever to Blade. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">As Blade came down from his ecstatic orgasm, his muscles\nsuddenly relaxed and he collapsed on top of Akir, who was more than willing to\nsnuggle Blade against him. He could hear Akir's chest rumbling with a soft\npurr.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Did you enjoy that, cutie?\" Akir asked while tenderly\nstroking Blade's neck and down his spine.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded. He was still panting and recovering from his\nclimax. His cock was buried deep inside Akir as he was pressed into his warmth\nup to his sheath. Warm, gooey seed oozed around his flesh.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"D- Did you?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir grinned and softly kissed Blade for just a moment,\nletting their tongues linger after. \"I did... You feel amazing,\" he answered and\nsqueezed Blade's twitching flesh with his muscles, drawing a quiet whimper from\nBlade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Is... is that what it feels like to take a female?\" Blade\nasked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and hugged Blade closely. \"Not quite the same,\nbut it has its similarities.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It was amazing,\" Blade said breathlessly and rested his\nhead on Akir's chest. Akir continued to purr as he held Blade against his warm,\nscaled body while tenderly stroking his feathers. Blade rested his eyes for a\nmoment, drifting away from consciousness until he slipped into a very pleasant\ndream.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So, you told Talia about us?\" Akir asked. He looked at\nBlade curiously as Blade's eyes wandered across the horizon. Waves of the sea\ncrashed against the cliffside below them, and the spray of the salt water\ndrifted in the wind and lightly showered them in tiny droplets, a fine, cool mist.\nTo their left was the city, across some large dunes and nestled in the sandy\nhills. To their right was uninhabited coastline stretching as far as the eye\ncould see, curving slightly outward toward the sea.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade loved it. He loved the smell of the sea, and he loved\nthe feeling of cool water sprinkling his hot, black and gold feathers. The\narid, desert air was very comfortable to him, and he liked how his feathers\nseemed fluffier after a day in the sun, but this was bliss&#8212;especially since he\ncould share it with his mate.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I did, and she took it rather well,\" he replied and smiled\nat Akir before he nuzzled him. They lay side by side together just at the edge\nof a cliff overlooking the deep blue sea. Ships crossed the waters: some coming\nand some going. When they were younger, they often played a game. They each\ntook turns making up a story about where each ship was going and why. Akir was\nnever very good at it, but Blade had a lot of fun making up stories!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir curled his tail with Blade's and wrapped his wing over\nBlade's back to pull him close. \"I find that rather surprising. She loves you\nand hates me; I imagine she wouldn't want me as your mate.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade chuckled and shook his head. \"She doesn't hate you.\nShe just thinks you need some more...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Discipline?\" he finished. \"Yeah, I know. She's only\nmentioned that how many times?\" He laughed and nuzzled Blade firmly. \"It\ndoesn't matter what she thinks anyway 'cause you're mine now!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wriggled happily and nudged Akir's snout with his own.\nHe looked into his sapphire eyes, seeing a deep, affectionate gaze in them&#8212;they\nreminded him of the ocean. \"I couldn't have asked for anything more.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir hummed and squeezed Blade with his wing. He doted\nBlade's snout with affectionate licks and nuzzles while Blade returned them. He\nfelt so happy being with Akir that his heart wanted to explode. Out of\neverything he could want in this world, it all seemed so miniscule when he was\nnext to Akir. He thanked all of the gods, real and unreal, for bringing Akir into\nhis life.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir was the only person in the world that loved Blade.\nTalia was the next most important person to him, but he had only known her for\nabout a year. He had known Akir his entire life! He reminisced about that day\nwhen Akir had saved him from death. Then his mind wandered to his parents. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He never knew why they abandoned him as a hatchling. Maybe\nhe was better off alone or maybe they had forgotten about him. He had always\nwanted to believe that they did love him, and maybe that they were searching\nfor him. It made him happy to think about that, to believe that there were at\nleast two others that loved Blade... But he knew that they didn't and never did.\nAkir made sure Blade knew that so he'd never get his hopes up.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade looked thoughtfully at Akir and held his paw with his\nown, squeezing it gently. Akir glanced at him, drawn away from the captivating\nsea.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed. He knew he wasn't supposed to pester Akir\nabout this, but maybe now that they were mates he'd finally tell him. \"What happened\nto your parents?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir grimaced, making Blade's stomach turn. Why did he have\nto ruin a perfect moment with him? \"S- Sorry... Forget it,\" he said and looked at\nthe ground in front of him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head. He took in a deep breath and exhaled it.\n\"I think it's about time you knew... I don't know why I've never been able to\ntalk about it before, but I feel better about it now.\" His expression softened\nas he bared a small smile at Blade. Blade looked at him intently, his curiosity\nbrimming.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir began, \"I had... known my parents rather well. They had\ngiven me every opportunity from when I was hatched to when I left them to show\nme who they really were.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"When you left them?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nodded and gritted his teeth. \"About a week before I\nmet you, I ran away from them. It was a dark, rainy night... They were arguing\nand fighting like they always had while I cowered away in my room, waiting for\nthe figurative storm to pass, but it never did. Instead, it was brought to\nme&#8212;again.\" Akir's eyes swirled with spite as his claws gouged the rocky surface\nbeneath them. Blade squeezed his paw comfortingly, but Akir didn't seem fazed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Apparently I had eaten too much food that night, so they\nbeat me. It was a regular occurrence ever since I hatched, and I was used to\nit. It was never enough to kill me, but it hurt... a lot... I&#8212;\" Akir choked up and\nturned his head away. Blade immediately nuzzled and comforted Akir with a soft\nwarble.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Th- Thanks, Blade... I limped away that night into the\npouring rain. I remembered the pain I felt... I always remembered. I didn't make\nit very far, and I ended up climbing into a crate of rice sacks to rest for the\nnight. As long as I was away from them, I didn't care where I slept. I curled\nup there, exhausted beyond belief, and when I woke up, I was rocking uneasily.\nThere was a lid over the crate, and I was too weak to open it. For nearly a\nweek, I stayed in that rocking crate. It never stopped rocking. I vomited even\nafter I had nothing left to puke up.\" Akir's muzzle contorted into a grimace. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"But... it wasn't the most miserable I had been. I realized\nnot too long after that I was on a ship in the middle of the sea. I could smell\nthe salt in the ocean breeze, and I heard the crewmen shouting things that I\ndidn't really understand, but it all made sense. It filled me with relief.\"\nAkir sniffled and nuzzled Blade firmly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So you weren't born here? You're from across the sea?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He nodded. \"I don't remember much of what it was like, but\neverything was green and luscious compared to here.\" Then he smiled and\ncontinued his story, \"I realized that I would never have to go back home again.\nI realized that I was... free... that I was away from my parents. It was, sadly,\nthe happiest day of my life. I was starving, disoriented, and sick, but I had\nnever felt better.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"After the ship had docked, they unloaded my crate and\nshipped it to a merchant. That merchant was really surprised to find a dying\ndragonet in their rice box!\" He spared a chuckle and continued, \"And he was the\nkindest person I had met up to that point. He fed me for a few days until I was\nfeeling better. I left him, too, not giving him much of a chance to even learn\nmy name.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A warm smile crossed his lips as he looked at Blade with\nlarge, adoring eyes. \"And that night I was given the chance to return the same\nkindness given to me. Although, my dragonet has stayed with me for far longer\nthan a few days!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grinned toothily and firmly gripped Akir's paw. \"And I\nwon't ever leave you.\" After listening to Akir's past, Blade felt terribly\nsorry for his mate. He also had an entire new outlook and understanding about\nAkir's life. He had never liked authority, and Blade could see clearly why that\nwas. His parents had left him scarred both physically and mentally, Blade\nrealized. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">There were a few scars along Akir's back where his scales\nwere missing and some around his shoulders. They were thin and pink, exposing\nhis flesh beneath that natural armor. They weren't all that noticeable either.\nWhen Blade had asked before where they had come from, Akir just shrugged and\nsaid <i>fighting</i>.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade cuddled comfortingly with Akir, softly nuzzling and\nlicking him. \"I'm sorry you had to go through that... I wish things could have\nbeen different for you,\" he said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head. \"I don't, and I'm glad everything\nhappened the way it had.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stared at Akir with a look of shock. \"W- Why? That\nsounds terrible...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir laughed brightly. \"Because I wouldn't have ever met\nyou, Blade.\" Akir's beautiful, blue spheres swirled as they met Blade's wide,\ngolden eyes. \"I'm glad those things happened to give me the opportunity to be\nwith you. I'd suffer through all of that again and more if it meant that I\ncould stay with you. Thankfully, I don't have to!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wanted to scream his joy. He had never felt so many\njoyful emotions coursing through him before. Tears wetted his eyes as he tried\nto blink them away. His heart thudded deeply inside his chest and his body\ncould hardly sit still. Their twined tails swayed back and forth as Blade moved\nthem unintentionally. He mouthed at words but couldn't seem to find any. So,\nAkir leaned forward and pressed their lips together.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gasped softly and spread his maw open as Akir's tongue\npushed inside. Their maws locked while their tongues grappled and their saliva\nmixed. Blade closed his eyes and delved deeply into the kiss. They kissed\npassionately, sharing their love intimately.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">As they kissed, Akir slowly started to roll Blade onto his\nback and shift over him. Blade's paws latched onto Akir's shoulders as he\njoined him belly to belly. Blue scales met gold feathers as Akir asserted\nhimself on top of Blade. Blade's hind legs held Akir between his thighs as\ntheir hips pressed together and their tails coiled.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A heated blush warmed Blade's cheeks as he felt Akir's\nnethers touching his own. He couldn't hold back the soft moans that escaped his\nlips as they kissed. Akir held the back of Blade's head while Blade held his\nneck, stroking up and down it. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">His arousal set in quickly, and he could tell Akir's was\ntoo. They were both panting and breathing heavily while they kissed. Both of\nthem moaned their lusts as paws caressed and touched intimately. Akir suckled\non Blade's tongue before he finally drew away. Blade opened his eyes and saw\nAkir's devious smirk.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">And it wasn't long before they were mating out in the open.\nBlade hadn't felt completely comfortable about it at first, but the pleasurable\nsensations and lusts urged him otherwise. Akir took him right there and then,\nmaking Blade moan and cry out his pleasure. Blade held Akir closely while their\nbodies rocked back and forth right on the edge of the cliff. Blade lay back,\ntaking each and every one of Akir's thrusts while their bodies mingled together\npassionately. To feel Akir's cock inside him sent Blade over the edge with\nbliss.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The release was fantastic, driving Blade mad with intense\npleasure. Akir claimed him once again, spilling his warm seed deep inside\nBlade's rump. Blade loved every second of it, and it wasn't long before they\nboth exhausted themselves and ended up cuddling in the afterglow, the sight of\nthe ocean forgotten as their attention focused solely on each other.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade woke up the next morning to find Akir missing from\ntheir bed. He blinked and sighed as he buried his head into the sheets. He\nhated mornings, and he hated waking up. Grogginess wore him down, making him\nwant to shut his eyes and find sleep again, but he forced himself to climb out\nof bed. His paws hit the ground just as he heard a familiar voice that wasn't\nAkir's.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Okay, just think about it! I think it would be fun, the\nthree of us together! We could make it an all-night thing, too!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He heard Akir chuckle. \"I'll let you know, Ves. I still need\nto talk to him about it. You know how Blade is.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grumbled and leaned against a wall. There was no way\nhe was going out there while Vespera was around. Why was she here, anyway? He\nthought Akir had broken off with her. He felt a slight jealous tinge, but that\nwas easy to shy away. He trusted Akir more than anyone else in the world.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He then heard their door open and shut and sighed with\nrelief. He slid through the drape and found Akir walking back to him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Oh, you're awake! Did she wake you?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shook his head. \"No... Why was she here?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled and motioned for Blade to come lie with him on\ntheir furs, so he happily padded on over. They lay down together side by side\nwith Akir's wing draped over Blade's back. \"I've been thinking a lot lately,\nBlade... about... about a hatchling.\" There was some excitement in Akir's voice, a\nrare thing for Blade to hear.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade peered at him. \"A hatchling? Like us having a\nhatchling?\" He never thought about it until now, but he realized that he and\nAkir couldn't produce and offspring... They couldn't make eggs together, so they\nwould never have a hatchling of their own. Blade felt sad about that, but it\nwas worth it if he could be with Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir scratched the back of his head and nodded. \"W- Would\nyou like to have one? An egg?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's brows furrowed. \"That's not possible...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Not for us both of course but... Vespera and I were talking\nabout having her be the mother. It's almost mating season and I&#8212;well&#8212;I want us\nto have a hatchling together. She agreed to bear our egg under one condition...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's eyes lit up with the possibilities of having their\nown hatchling to raise... a hatchling to be fathers to. Warmth filled his chest\nas he thought about it. \"W- What's the condition?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled and nudged Blade's snout. \"That we both mate\nwith her at the same time.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade blushed deeply. He hadn't thought about that. One of\nthem would have to mate with her so she could bear an egg. He didn't like that\nidea at all! It felt like they would be breaking a vow or something, and Blade\nwas very fond of keeping Akir to himself.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I know what you're thinking, but it's a one-time thing,\nBlade. Don't you want a hatchling?\" Again, Blade could hear the excitement\nbrimming in Akir's voice. He couldn't say no to that.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and exposed a small grin to Akir. \"With you,\nmore than anything... But I wish we didn't have to bring her into it.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nuzzled Blade comfortingly. \"I understand, Blade, but\nthis is our only real chance right now. We could try to find another female,\nbut I trust Vespera.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and looked into Akir's eyes. He saw a whole lot\nof hope and pleading in them. He grinned toothily and dipped his head. \"Okay,\nfine.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir licked Blade's nose affectionately and hugged him\ntightly with his wing. \"This means a lot to me. Thank you!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade giggled and scrunched his face as Akir's slimy tongue\ntickled him. It made Blade nervous to think about being a father, but it also\nmade him super excited. It was going to be a big step for them as mates, and he\nwas more than happy to take it. He just had to disregard the fact that they\nwould be mating with Vespera!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n</span>\n </body>\n</html>\n"

    "content": "SHARING A BED\n\n\"What do you think she's going to say?\" Blade asked while walking beside Akir.\nThey were on their way to see Vespera to explain that Akir was no longer\ninterested in her. The plan was not to mention that he found another mate, and\nthey especially weren't going to mention who that other mate was!\n\nAkir shrugged his purple wings. \"It's been a week since I last saw her. She's\nprobably moved on already.\" Akir took a sharp turn to the right, his head\ndarting back and forth in search of her home. They were deep inside the feral\ndistrict where housing complexes smashed together tightly, leaving no room at\nall between them. It was a very cramped area, and it was particularly difficult\nfor ferals to walk through the narrow street since most of them were rather big\nwhen compared to the two-legs. They had to squeeze past several others to make\ntheir way down the path.\n\n\"You think so? Sounds like you shouldn't have mated with her anyway,\" Blade\nsnapped with a sly grin.\n\nAkir chuckled and poked Blade with a tail. \"Still jealous, huh?\"\n\nBlade giggled and shook his head. \"Not anymore!\"\n\n\"Good. I can't have my mate still being jealous when we've been together for\nalmost a week already.\" Akir nuzzled his neck and nipped at his jaw.\n\nBlade blushed deeply and grinned, thinking about what Akir said earlier that day\nwhen they were out shopping for furniture. \"I'm really anxious to... mate with\nyou again tonight, especially now that we have the new bed,\" he admitted. \"I've\nbeen thinking about it all day.\"\n\nAkir chuckled and smiled toothily at Blade. \"I've noticed!\" he teased as his\neyes peered beneath Blade.\n\nBlade meeped and blushed even hotter as he looked down. \"Have I...?\"\n\nAkir nodded. \"You must really like mating with me, Blade. We've done it every\nnight so far, and you still keep getting erections in public.\"\n\nBlade stammered and flushed heatedly. \"I didn't think anyone n- noticed...\"\n\n\"I'm probably not the only one,\" Akir teased and giggled as Blade's feathers\npoofed out.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" Blade whined, horrified and embarrassed.\n\n\"'Cause it's cute. And it looks like we're here,\" he said and pointed at the\nsecond story to the front of a hovel with some common runes carved into the\nstone next to the door. Blade didn't know what they read, but Akir seemed to.\n\nThe buildings weren't all that high; Blade estimated about five or six stories,\nand they were built like staircases, one floor like a step to the next. They\nhopped up to the second story platform and knocked carefully on the door. It\nlooked like the door was about to fall off.\n\n\"What if she's not home?\" Blade asked.\n\n\"Then we'll find her or come back tomorrow.\"\n\n\"What if she gets really angry?\"\n\n\"Then we'll just leave.\"\n\nBlade nodded and continued, \"What if—\"\n\n\"Blade!\" Akir scolded and nipped Blade. \"Relax.\"\n\nBlade shuffled around on his paws and refolded his wings. \"O- Okay, sorry.\" He\ndidn't know why, but he was feeling very nervous! Normally when he was around\nAkir, his confidence tended to rub off on Blade.\n\nAkir shook his head disapprovingly with a small grin. \"You're ridiculous\nsometimes.\"\n\nThen the door creaked open and Vespera poked her black head out. A big, toothy\nsmile immediately spread her lips as she swung the door the rest of the way open\nand invited them inside.\n\n\"Akir! Blade! It's good to see you! This is quite the surprise. I never imagined\nthat you'd show up with Blade this time. Have something planned for the three of\nus?\"\n\nBlade never understood why Akir had fallen for her. She was a chatterbox, and\nher voice was a bit annoying... It was to Blade, at least. He bared a small,\nfriendly smile anyway and stepped inside after Akir. It smelled of feral, female\ndragon inside; her scent filled the tiny space, and it tickled Blade's nostrils.\nHe wasn't used to that sort of aroma at all; it made him feel a little tingly.\n\nHer home was just one room, having everything she needed surrounding them.\n\n\"No, nothing like that,\" Akir explained with a chuckle. \"Blade is much too shy.\"\n\nBlade shot him an uncertain glance. Was there something he missed?\n\n\"Oh, I see. That's a shame. You're a very handsome dragon too, and I'd love to\nmess up your feathers,\" she chirred to Blade. Blade shrunk back a little with a\nsmall smile, wanting to hide behind Akir. \"So what brings you here then? Are we\ngoing somewhere? What about food? I'm hungry!\"\n\nBlade had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. She was like this when he had\nfirst met her too. Even if she was nice, he could hardly stand her. Maybe he\nwasn't actually jealous of her and just disliked her instead.\n\nAkir shook his head and looked at her seriously. \"I need to talk to you about\nsomething rather important.\" Then he glanced back at Blade and gestured to the\ndoor with a wing. \"Alone, if you don't mind, Blade.\"\n\nBlade nodded and dipped his head politely before slipping out the door. He stood\nout in the glaring sun, feeling it warming his feathers delightfully. The skies\nwere clear with a deep blue hue, making Blade wonder briefly if there was an\nocean way up there where he couldn't fly. He felt much better out here than in\nthat stuffy room with that blabbermouth. Still, he couldn't help but to feel a\nlittle curious about what Vespera's reaction would be. He pressed his ear to the\ndoor and tried to listen in.\n\n\"—that would be best for the both of us,\" Akir finished.\n\nIt was rather hard to hear Vespera's higher pitched voice, but he could faintly\nmake out her words. \"I can't believe you're already leaving me... I thought we\nwere good together! I really enjoyed mating with you. And you liked it too! Why\ndon't you want to anymore? Is there someone else?\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"I do like you Vespera. You're very nice and all, but there is someone else.\"\nBlade gulped. He said he wouldn't tell her!\n\n\"Who is it?\" Vespera half-growled. \"She better not be prettier than me.\"\n\n\"Well, she's not a she.\" Akir wasn't following the plan...\n\nBlade sighed but relaxed a little. He chuckled, imagining how stunned Vespera\nmust be right now. He bet that she'd never imagine that Akir liked males!\n\n\"Oh, so you finally convinced Blade to mate with you? That was kind of fast.\nHow'd you seduce him? Was it easy? Was it as good as you'd thought it—\"\n\nBlade's jaw dropped and he pulled his ear away. She knew!? And Akir planned on\nseducing Blade? Blade felt his stomach turn unpleasantly as his chest ached.\n\nDid Akir even care about being his mate? Had he just wanted Blade to satisfy his\nlusts? He stared at the door and felt himself wanting to cry. He backed away\nuntil he nearly slipped off the small platform.\n\nHe knew Akir better than that. He wouldn't ever do something like that to Blade.\nAnd what he said that night they mated... that had been real, right? Was it\nsomething he meant and not just something he said to make Blade feel happy? They\nhad loved each other since they were little, like siblings, but did Akir really\nlove Blade like a mate? Why would Akir not tell him? Blade shook his aching head\nand took off. He needed to clear his mind. He flew to the only other home he\nknew: Talia's house.\n\n* * *\n\nBlade nearly burst through Talia's door when she opened it. He shoved right past\nher and then sniffled as he started to cry. He let loose all of the emotions\nchurning inside him and lay on his belly while covering his head with his paws.\nHe couldn't stop thinking that Akir had just used him, no matter how much he\ntried to believe otherwise. He felt Talia kneeling down beside him and patting\nhis shoulders between his wings.\n\n\"What's wrong, Blade?\" she asked worriedly. Having a sobbing dragon burst\nthrough your door must be quite the surprise!\n\nBlade gritted his teeth. Talia didn't know that he and Akir were mates now. He\nmeant to tell her soon, but this was the first time he had seen her in a month.\n\"A- Akir...\" he mumbled.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\nBlade shook his head and whimpered. \"He is th- the problem.\"\n\nHe could almost feel Talia tense up. \"What'd he do?\" she hissed. \"Did he hurt\nyou?\"\n\nBlade quickly shook his head again, not wanting her to lash out at Akir. \"No!\nIt's s- something else...\" He wiped his tears away and looked at Talia. He\nrecollected himself the best he could, taking a deep breath. \"It'll take some\nexplanation...\"\n\nShe grinned softly at him and sat down beside him cross-legged. \"I'm all ears.\"\n\nBlade then proceeded to explain their recent events... in as little of detail as\npossible. He told her about Vespera, how he was jealous of her, how him and Akir\nthen mated, and then about how happy he was being his mate until today.\n\n\"She made it sound like he was only interested in mating with me,\" he finished.\n\n\"And is it true?\" Blade was surprised that she didn't react much to him and Akir\nbeing mates. Maybe it was a normal thing after all!\n\nBlade shrugged his wings and sniffled. \"I- I don't think so...\"\n\nTalia chuckled. \"So, you got yourself all worked up when you don't even know\nwhat really happened?\"\n\nBlade looked at her, and his mouth moved as if he wanted to speak, but he\ncouldn't find the words. He shook his head and stared at the floor, his ears\ndrooping. He clawed a rut in a plank of wood. He knew he had acted hasty, and he\nlet his emotions get the better of him.\n\n\"Oh, Blade... Sometimes, I think you're just as dull as he is. Akir is probably\nworried to death about you right now.\"\n\n\"You th- think so?\" He felt rather foolish for thinking that Akir used him, and\nit frustrated him that he had to come to Talia for him to realize that. But he\nwas glad he did. He knew now without a shadow of doubt that Akir loved him.\nWhatever Vespera had said must have been something else entirely!\n\nTalia nodded and smiled softly at him. \"I never thought you two would become\nmates, but I'm very happy for you both. I know how much you love Akir.\"\n\nBlade smiled happily and wiped away his remaining tears. \"He makes me really\nhappy... And I think I make him happy too.\"\n\nTalia's eyes swirled with memories that passed before her eyes. Blade could see\nhow she reminisced about something she held close to her heart. It made him want\nto ask about it, but she stopped him. \"You better get going, Blade. Akir might\ntear down the city looking for you!\"\n\nBlade nodded and stood up. He gave her an affectionate nuzzle and left. \"Thanks,\nTalia!\"\n\nHe leapt to the sky and saw that the blazing sun was still high in the clear\nsky. He angled his wings and turned toward their home. He hoped that Akir wasn't\nangry with him for leaving so suddenly. He could only imagine how worried he\nmust be, especially after the last time Blade went missing. Blade sighed and\nsped forward. He knew he was going to be in trouble!\n\nBlade opened the door to their home and peaked in, expecting to see Akir waiting\nfor him with an angry look on his face. But there wasn't a blue and purple\ndragon in sight. He sighed with relief, glad to not be scolded just after\nreturning home. He stepped inside and lay down on their old bedding that they\nmoved to the middle of the main room. He waited for Akir to return, but as an\nhour slowly passed, a gnawing feeling clawed at his stomach.\n\nHe knew Akir was probably out looking for him, worried to death. He wished he\ncould leave to look for Akir himself, but if he did, then the chances of Akir\nfinding him soon were even slimmer—plus, he could return any minute. He had to\nwait and accept Akir's wrath when he returned. He only ever got angry when Blade\ndid something foolish that made him concerned, and this would certainly be one\nof those times. Blade curled up and rested his head on his tail, waiting in\nsilence.\n\nWhen the door creaked open, Blade's head shot up. He had fallen asleep while\nwaiting for Akir, and he saw that it was dark out now. His heart nearly stopped\nin his chest while his head swirled with guilty thoughts. Akir had been out\nlooking for him for hours while he napped! As soon as his eyes met Akir's, he\nexpected to see a malevolent storm brewing in the twin sapphires... but he\ncouldn't really place what he saw.\n\n\"Blade...\" Akir rushed over to him and practically fell on top of him. He\nwrapped his limbs around Blade, squeezing him tight while his wings enveloped\nhim like a warm blanket. Blade squeaked as he was squeezed almost too tight! His\nfeathers fluffed up as Akir buried his snout into Blade's neck. He could feel\nAkir's limbs trembling as if they were too exhausted to continue hugging him,\nbut Akir persisted until Blade heard a quiet whimper and felt warm tears drip\nonto his feathers.\n\nBlade's heart nearly shattered. He clenched his teeth tightly and embraced Akir\nback. He had prepared himself for a bloodbath, but he did not prepare himself\nfor this...\n\n\"I- I'm so s- sorry, Akir,\" he sobbed. How could he ever have thought Akir\ndidn't care about him?\n\n\"You st- stupid, feathered id- idiot!\" he sputtered. Blade could tell that Akir\nwas trying to regain his composure, but he was failing; Blade could see right\nthrough him. His normally strong composure was crushed. \"I looked everywhere for\nyou...\"\n\nAkir wasn't dumb. He had probably checked their home first before Blade had\nreturned. After that, he probably searched every street, alley, and yard for\nBlade until he couldn't anymore. Akir was exhausted and Blade could feel his\nheart thudding heavily and quickly inside his chest. He was breathing hard, too.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Blade repeated and squeezed Akir while pulling him snugly against\nhis soft body, acting like a pillow for his mate. He cried and tears streamed\ndown his cheeks. Akir was sniffling too, in a constant battle to stop crying.\nThey continued like this for a few minutes, the both of them letting their pent\nup emotions seep from them. Blade felt guilty and Akir was relieved.\n\n\"I thought something bad happened again... I thought I had lost you,\" Akir\nmumbled and pulled Blade tightly against him as Blade turned onto his back.\nBlade wrapped his arms and wings around Akir, hugging him equally as tight.\n\nBlade shook his head and buried his muzzle in Akir's shoulder. \"I was being d-\ndumb,\" he said.\n\n\"Where did you go?\"\n\n\"Talia's...\"\n\n\"Why?\" he pressed.\n\nHe didn't really want to tell Akir why—he felt very foolish about it—but he knew\nhe had to. \"I th- thought that you didn't really love me like a mate.\"\n\nAkir pulled away and looked at Blade in genuine shock. \"Why would you ever think\nthat?\"\n\nBlade sniffed and avoided meeting his eyes. \"I overheard Vespera talking... a-\nabout how you told her that you planned on mating with me. She made it sound\nlike you d- didn't care about me...\"\n\nAkir's expressions softened as an amused grin curled his lips. \"Blade... You got\nall worked up over that?\"\n\nBlade winced and nodded. Talia had asked the same thing! He knew he\noverreacted... by a lot. Had he just sat there and waited for Akir, he could\nhave avoided this whole situation.\n\nAkir chuckled and wiped Blade's tears away. \"You didn't hear what I said after\nthat, did you?\"\n\nBlade shook his head and looked up at Akir curiously. He didn't seem as upset as\nhe had expected him to be.\n\nThey were lying together, belly to belly, and half-mindedly cuddling. Blade's\nforepaws stroked down Akir's flanks as a blush warmed his cheeks. He realized\nhow foolish he really was as he looked into Akir's eyes. He had a hard time\nbelieving that he was actually Akir's mate. It felt like nothing really changed\nbetween them, but cuddling intimately with him now brought a new light to his\neyes. They never did this before, and it felt very warming and relaxing. It felt\ngood to feel loved.\n\n\"Good, 'cause I'm not going to tell you,\" he teased with a big grin.\n\nBlade giggled and nuzzled Akir. \"Tell me!\"\n\nAkir shook his head. \"No... It's too sappy.\"\n\n\"Sappy?\" A playful grin spread Blade's lips. \"That's not like you.\"\n\n\"I know, that's why I won't repeat it!\" He nipped at Blade's neck and\naffectionately licked him. A long moment of silence passed as Akir seemed to be\ndeep in thought.\n\n\"Just know that I love you, Blade, with all of my heart. I'm still getting used\nto this whole mateship thing, since you've always been my little brother, but I\nlove you and care for you like a mate... I think I always have.\"\n\nBlade almost melted in Akir's arms as he held him closely and tenderly doted\nhim. \"I feel the same about you, Akir,\" Blade said with a toothy smile. \"I love\nyou, and I won't ever do that to you again.\"\n\nAkir's sapphire gems sparkled with delight, unmistakably expressing the joy he\nfound in Blade's words. He warbled softly and nuzzled Blade's neck, soon burying\nhis muzzle in Blade's feathers. \"As long as you're safe, I don't care, Blade.\"\n\n\"So, you're not mad then?\"\n\nA soft smile parted Akir's lips. \"How could I be with a face like that?\"\n\nBlade grinned happily and giggled as Akir licked his face, feeling his wet,\nslimy tongue against his smaller, prickly feathers.\n\n\"Just don't run off on me like that,\" Akir said and licked between Blade's white\nhorns.\n\nBlade nodded and hugged Akir snugly. He thought about how mates would act, so he\ngently caressed Akir's scales, his paws tracing up and down his flank. Akir\ncooed softly to Blade and did the same to him while sensually nibbling and\nlicking his neck up to his chin. Blade sighed and relaxed as he exposed his neck\nto Akir, feeling much better already. Their tails twined together and swayed\nback and forth while they cuddled intimately.\n\nHeat flushed Blade's cheeks as he focused on all the pleasant feelings coursing\nthrough him. He lay back as Akir's belly pressed against his, and then a quiet\nmoan escaped his lips as he felt Akir's warm nethers mashing against his. He\ngasped and suddenly felt his loins warming with arousal while their bodies\nmelded together, scales against feathers.\n\n\"A- Akir...\"\n\n\"Why don't we go try out our new bed?\" Akir cooed as he grinded firmly against\nBlade. \"You've been waiting all day for this.\"\n\nBlade looked up at him and nodded eagerly, so they separated for the moment,\nstood up, and slipped behind their drapes into their bedroom. Instead of the\npile of bedding they had before, there was now a solid, large bed built for two\ndragons scooted up against the wall.\n\nBlade stepped up onto it first and flopped lazily down, bouncing slightly\nagainst the cushiony material. The bed slightly dipped beneath his weight, and\nit dipped only slightly more when Akir joined him. Blade rolled onto his back as\nAkir lay on top of him, resuming their previous position as they snuggled\ntogether.\n\nBlade warbled happily and nuzzled Akir, feeling much more comfortable now that\nthere was cushion against his back. Akir grinned down at him and then started to\nlick and nuzzle beneath his chin. Blade gasped softly and held Akir closely. He\ngripped his flanks between his thighs and wrapped his arms and wings around his\nback. Their hips met and fit together perfectly as their tails entwined behind\nthem. Their sheaths touched while their balls rubbed and molded together.\n\nAkir doted Blade's neck affectionately, licking and nibbling up and down it\nwhile his firm body sensually grinded against Blade's. A soft moan escaped\nBlade's open mouth as he breathed in deep breaths, feeling his arousal quickly\nstirring his senses. His forepaws traced Akir's muscles, rubbing and caressing\nthem while they explored his scaled body. Blade had always enjoyed the feeling\nof scales and often wondered what they would feel like instead of feathers\ncovering his body. They felt so smooth against his paw pads, and Akir's were\nvery pretty.\n\nAkir seemed to wonder the same about Blade's feathers. His paws sifted through\nthe soft fluff around Blade's shoulders and down his flanks, feeling and\nexploring him. That made Blade wiggle and shudder with delight until he moaned\nagain and felt his exposed flesh starting to rub against Akir's swelling sheath.\nAkir cooed and looked between their legs.\n\n\"Is that what I think it is, cutie?\" he teased and rubbed against Blade's firm\nsheath with his own. Blade flexed his toes as he felt their balls mashing\ntogether and their cocks touching. Their exposed tips rubbed together while each\nof them was aroused. Blade stole a peek as his wings dropped to his sides,\nseeing Akir's flesh touching his own. It was warm, smooth, and slick. Pre mixed\nand collected along their shafts as both of their erections grew and rubbed\ntogether.\n\nBlade panted lightly and groaned with lust while he let Akir arouse him. He lay\nback, blushing warmly as Akir doted his neck and pushed their hips together.\nPleasant thoughts and feelings swam inside Blade's head, urging him to grind\nagainst his mate.\n\n\"I- I love mating with you,\" Blade said with sincerity, looking up into Akir's\neyes.\n\nAkir smiled down at him, a toothy grin curling his lips. \"Does it feel good?\" he\nasked as his forepaw started to grope his and Blade's cocks, rubbing them\ntogether. That was a favorite of Blade's; it made his toes curl while he gasped\nwith delight. To feel Akir's sensitive organ against his own made him shudder.\n\n\"Y- Yes... very good.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Akir lowered his muzzle to Blade's and licked his lips lovingly. Blade\ncooed and parted his lips to lick back at Akir's tongue. They shared their\nsaliva while their tongues mingled together, and then Akir pressed his lips\nfirmly to Blade's. His tongue slipped inside Blade's mouth, making Blade's\ncheeks flush intensely as they kissed. His eyes bulged as he sucked in a quick\nbreath.\n\nKissing like this was a rare sign of affection to dragons. Most mates would wait\nuntil they had eggs together to even attempt kissing. It held a deep, heartfelt\nmeaning that most often signified mateship for life. Blade could hardly contain\nhis excitement!\n\nBlade's heart thudded deeply and rapidly in his chest as he melted in the\naffection. He closed his eyes, losing himself almost immediately. They mouthed\nat each other, their lips touching while their tongues explored each other's\nmaws. Blade's wings fluttered and rubbed against Akir's as their woven tails\nswayed from one side of the bed to the other. Akir stopped everything else he\nwas doing and delved deep into their passionate kiss. Their tongues wrestled and\ntwined while their breaths were ragged. Blade softly held the back of Akir's\nhead while turning and twisting his own impulsively to get all of the good\nangles. The feelings of adoration that ignited his heart were unlike anything he\nhad felt before, and he could share it all with his Akir... his mate.\n\nWhen they finally separated, their eyes met, blue and gold. They were both\nspeechless and breathing hard with soft grins at their lips.\n\nBlade placed a paw on Akir's chest and half-mindedly felt around his firm\nmuscles there. \"That... That was amazing, Akir,\" he said.\n\nAkir nuzzled Blade tenderly and kissed him again, wanting another taste. Blade\nlightly pushed and caressed Akir's chest while cocking his head sideways and\nsuckling on his tongue. This was like a dream come true to him. His body was the\nwarmest and most relaxed it ever had been while he could feel the deep pounding\nof his heart echoing throughout.\n\nThis kiss was much shorter than the last, and it ended when Akir flipped onto\nhis back. They switched positions, and Blade was now on top, looking down at\nAkir. His eyes lingered on his smooth cock before he pressed their hips together\nand replicated what Akir did to him, grinding and rubbing their nethers\ntogether.\n\n\"Take me, Blade,\" Akir half-whispered. \"Mate with me.\"\n\nA confused expression crossed Blade's face. \"You want me to...\" Blade had always\nbeen the bottom; he was always the one to take Akir's cock, never the other way\naround.\n\nAkir chuckled and nodded. \"I want you to feel that pleasure too.\" He spread his\nlegs wide and presented himself to Blade. Blade blushed warmly as lust and\nexcitement welled within him. He backed up a bit as he sat upright and stared\nbetween Akir's legs.\n\nBetween his muscular thighs was his twitching cock and his drooping package\nbeneath it. And below his dangling stones was his tailhole. Akir didn't seem to\nmind that Blade was more curious than anything—he never really had much of a\nchance like this with Akir before. Blade reached down with his soft, fuzzy\nforepaws and felt Akir's cock. He stroked it up and down and felt the thick rod\nof meat that he had enjoyed on several previous occasions. It twitched and\npulsed in his grasp as a drizzle of pre oozed out of the tip.\n\n\"Oh, Blade,\" Akir moaned as he flexed his toes. Blade smiled and rubbed Akir's\nlength a few more times before groping and squeezing his stones. That received\nhim a pleasured coo from Akir. Excitement coursed through Blade as he felt\nAkir's nethers, rubbing and fondling them curiously. Even though Akir had\nscales, his balls felt almost as soft as Blade's.\n\nThen Blade decided to leave more of his exploration for later as his lust urged\nhim on. He scooted up again and pressed the tip of his cock firmly against\nAkir's tail base. He lined it up with his tailhole, watching as he guided it\ninto his mate, like Akir had a few times before with Blade.\n\nBlade sucked in a deep breath as he felt his flesh penetrate Akir's rear. It\nslipped inside easier than he thought it would and was greeted by warm, soft\nmuscles squeezing around it. Akir gasped and moaned Blade's name encouragingly.\nBlade's cock slid inside Akir deeper, spreading his tight ring of flesh apart as\neach ridge on the underside of his shaft slipped inside. Blade had never felt\nanything so warm and soft around his cock before. Akir's maw had been one thing,\nbut this felt utterly amazing. His sheath firmly pressed against his mate's\nentrance, his cock enveloped completely in Akir's tight passage.\n\n\"A- Akir... you feel so... amazing.\"\n\nAkir smiled at Blade and wrapped his legs around him. His thighs gripped Blade's\nflanks while his forepaws stroked the golden mane along his back. \"Your cock\nfeels amazing, too,\" he cooed softly into Blade's ear. That made Blade shudder\nwith delight, especially when Akir squeezed his flesh with his muscles.\n\nBlade was already panting as he hilted Akir. He had no idea how long he would\nlast, and he wanted to last long enough for Akir, but he couldn't wait to feel\nthat pleasure of taking his mate. He withdrew slowly, gasping and moaning as his\nridges tugged against Akir's walls. He pulled his cock out until only the tip\nremained, and then he pushed quickly back in. He shuddered and hung his head.\nDrizzles of his pre escaped his tip and spilled into Akir's passage, helping to\nlubricate his penetrating flesh. Blade repeated the motion again and again until\nhe finally had a steady pattern. He humped Akir gently, softly moaning his name\nwhile he did.\n\nBlade watched Akir's reactions intently, wanting to please his mate more than\nanything. Akir's eyes were sewn tightly shut while his maw was parted. He panted\njust like Blade did, and the occasional grunt escaped his lips. Blade's length\nslid in and out of his tailhole repeatedly, rubbing and spreading apart his\ntight walls. Their hips gently patted together while their bodies rocked in\nunison. Akir held Blade closely, wrapping his limbs around him while eliciting\nhis pleasure.\n\nAkir's cock twitched and bounced beneath him, catching Blade's eye. He saw a\nsmall pool of pre building on Akir's scales while string oozed from his tapered\ntip. Blade had never imagined lusting for a cock before they became mates, but\nnow it was all he could think about. He reached a paw down, leaving the other\nplanted firmly on the bed to keep his balance. He gripped Akir's length as it\npulsed within his grasp and started to stroke him up and down, sliding his soft\npaw from the tip of his flesh to the thicker base.\n\n\"Oh wow... Blade...\"\n\nAkir moaned loudly and squirmed beneath Blade as he pleasured him in two places\nat once. Blade continued to steadily hump Akir while pawing him off. Akir's\nmuscles quivered around Blade's length in time with the light throbs of his\nslick member.\n\nBlade felt Akir's hard, warm cock, squeezing it in his grasp. His grip slid\nsmoothly up and down, lubricated by pre and natural secretions that made it\neasier to mate. Feeling Akir's sensitive organ was exciting to Blade. He\nthoroughly enjoyed hearing Akir's encouraging moans as he stroked his mate.\n\n\"Nngh... that feels so good...\"\n\nBlade couldn't have asked for a more perfect position to be in with Akir. He\nloved every second of it, being able to give pleasure while also receiving it.\nIt was the most intimate mating they had done yet. Their bodies pressed\ntogether, belly to belly, while Blade humped and stroked Akir. And he loved how\nhe could watch Akir's expressions churn. His head lightly bobbed back and forth\nwhile his body swayed with Blade's. He would wince and moan and gasp all the\nwhile Blade thrust in and out of him.\n\nAs Blade mated Akir, his speed started to pick up. He could hardly contain\nhimself as pleasure and lust warmed his loins immensely. Reluctantly, he took\nhis paw away from Akir's cock, using it for balance as his claws dug into their\nbed. He drove his hips into his mate's harder and faster as his instincts fogged\nhis mind.\n\nHaving Akir's walls rubbing against every angle of his sensitive flesh sent the\nback of Blade's skull blooming with bliss. It wasn't long before their hips were\nmeeting with wet smacks. Blade's pre lubricated his length enough that he could\nquickly slip in and out of Akir's warm, clenching passage.\n\n\"Oh, Blade... d- don't stop...\"\n\nBlade moaned back at Akir, refusing to ever stop as long as his mate was\nenjoying this. He could feel Akir's body reacting each time he hilted him,\nfeeling his muscles twitch inside and out. Akir's thighs held Blade's flanks\ntightly as Blade pushed him into the bed with every thrust. The bed creaked as\ntheir bodies moved together in unison, but the annoying squeaking was drowned\nout by their constant moans and humping.\n\n\"Aah!\" he moaned. \"B- Blade... Yesss...\" Blade blushed deeply as he heard Akir's\nsultry voice. And then a moment later, Akir's muscles tightened and flexed\naround Blade's cock, clenching him tightly while they pulsated rapidly. Blade\ndidn't know quite what was going on as Akir writhed around on his back, but then\nhe felt warm, gooey liquid spraying into his belly feathers. Blade looked down\nas he rolled his hips into Akir's and saw his cock throbbing and spilling\ncopious ropes of his seed, making a mess on both of their bellies.\n\nBlade's moans joined Akir's as he redoubled his efforts, feeling even closer to\nan orgasm now. He was surprised Akir finished before he did, but that must have\nmeant that he did well! Akir's body moved with Blade's, sliding back and forth\nacross the bed as Blade pounded against him. He buried his warm face into Akir's\nchest, panting heavily and moaning between gasps until he finally felt it all\nrelease.\n\nHe elicited a lewd groan as he shoved his length as deep as he could into Akir's\nrear. He climaxed, his cock pulsing and throbbing rapidly as his warm seed\nfilled Akir's passage. He could feel it spilling and oozing around his cock as\nhe held himself deep inside Akir's rump.\n\nAkir nuzzled Blade lovingly and pressed their foreheads together while moaning\nto him encouragingly. \"That's it, Blade... Ooh!\" Blade could hardly make sense\nof anything. He lost himself in the blissful pleasure that claimed his body. His\nmuscles froze in place as Akir held him and cooed while rubbing his body. Rope\nafter rope of Blade's seed ejaculated into Akir's tight, quivering passage,\nlasting for what felt like forever to Blade.\n\nAs Blade came down from his ecstatic orgasm, his muscles suddenly relaxed and he\ncollapsed on top of Akir, who was more than willing to snuggle Blade against\nhim. He could hear Akir's chest rumbling with a soft purr.\n\n\"Did you enjoy that, cutie?\" Akir asked while tenderly stroking Blade's neck and\ndown his spine.\n\nBlade nodded. He was still panting and recovering from his climax. His cock was\nburied deep inside Akir as he was pressed into his warmth up to his sheath.\nWarm, gooey seed oozed around his flesh.\n\n\"D- Did you?\"\n\nAkir grinned and softly kissed Blade for just a moment, letting their tongues\nlinger after. \"I did... You feel amazing,\" he answered and squeezed Blade's\ntwitching flesh with his muscles, drawing a quiet whimper from Blade.\n\n\"Is... is that what it feels like to take a female?\" Blade asked.\n\nAkir chuckled and hugged Blade closely. \"Not quite the same, but it has its\nsimilarities.\"\n\n\"It was amazing,\" Blade said breathlessly and rested his head on Akir's chest.\nAkir continued to purr as he held Blade against his warm, scaled body while\ntenderly stroking his feathers. Blade rested his eyes for a moment, drifting\naway from consciousness until he slipped into a very pleasant dream.\n\n* * *\n\n\"So, you told Talia about us?\" Akir asked. He looked at Blade curiously as\nBlade's eyes wandered across the horizon. Waves of the sea crashed against the\ncliffside below them, and the spray of the salt water drifted in the wind and\nlightly showered them in tiny droplets, a fine, cool mist. To their left was the\ncity, across some large dunes and nestled in the sandy hills. To their right was\nuninhabited coastline stretching as far as the eye could see, curving slightly\noutward toward the sea.\n\nBlade loved it. He loved the smell of the sea, and he loved the feeling of cool\nwater sprinkling his hot, black and gold feathers. The arid, desert air was very\ncomfortable to him, and he liked how his feathers seemed fluffier after a day in\nthe sun, but this was bliss—especially since he could share it with his mate.\n\n\"I did, and she took it rather well,\" he replied and smiled at Akir before he\nnuzzled him. They lay side by side together just at the edge of a cliff\noverlooking the deep blue sea. Ships crossed the waters: some coming and some\ngoing. When they were younger, they often played a game. They each took turns\nmaking up a story about where each ship was going and why. Akir was never very\ngood at it, but Blade had a lot of fun making up stories!\n\nAkir curled his tail with Blade's and wrapped his wing over Blade's back to pull\nhim close. \"I find that rather surprising. She loves you and hates me; I imagine\nshe wouldn't want me as your mate.\"\n\nBlade chuckled and shook his head. \"She doesn't hate you. She just thinks you\nneed some more...\"\n\n\"Discipline?\" he finished. \"Yeah, I know. She's only mentioned that how many\ntimes?\" He laughed and nuzzled Blade firmly. \"It doesn't matter what she thinks\nanyway 'cause you're mine now!\"\n\nBlade wriggled happily and nudged Akir's snout with his own. He looked into his\nsapphire eyes, seeing a deep, affectionate gaze in them—they reminded him of the\nocean. \"I couldn't have asked for anything more.\"\n\nAkir hummed and squeezed Blade with his wing. He doted Blade's snout with\naffectionate licks and nuzzles while Blade returned them. He felt so happy being\nwith Akir that his heart wanted to explode. Out of everything he could want in\nthis world, it all seemed so miniscule when he was next to Akir. He thanked all\nof the gods, real and unreal, for bringing Akir into his life.\n\nAkir was the only person in the world that loved Blade. Talia was the next most\nimportant person to him, but he had only known her for about a year. He had\nknown Akir his entire life! He reminisced about that day when Akir had saved him\nfrom death. Then his mind wandered to his parents.\n\nHe never knew why they abandoned him as a hatchling. Maybe he was better off\nalone or maybe they had forgotten about him. He had always wanted to believe\nthat they did love him, and maybe that they were searching for him. It made him\nhappy to think about that, to believe that there were at least two others that\nloved Blade... But he knew that they didn't and never did. Akir made sure Blade\nknew that so he'd never get his hopes up.\n\nBlade looked thoughtfully at Akir and held his paw with his own, squeezing it\ngently. Akir glanced at him, drawn away from the captivating sea.\n\n\"Blade?\"\n\nBlade sighed. He knew he wasn't supposed to pester Akir about this, but maybe\nnow that they were mates he'd finally tell him. \"What happened to your parents?\"\n\nAkir grimaced, making Blade's stomach turn. Why did he have to ruin a perfect\nmoment with him? \"S- Sorry... Forget it,\" he said and looked at the ground in\nfront of him.\n\nAkir shook his head. He took in a deep breath and exhaled it. \"I think it's\nabout time you knew... I don't know why I've never been able to talk about it\nbefore, but I feel better about it now.\" His expression softened as he bared a\nsmall smile at Blade. Blade looked at him intently, his curiosity brimming.\n\nAkir began, \"I had... known my parents rather well. They had given me every\nopportunity from when I was hatched to when I left them to show me who they\nreally were.\"\n\n\"When you left them?\"\n\nAkir nodded and gritted his teeth. \"About a week before I met you, I ran away\nfrom them. It was a dark, rainy night... They were arguing and fighting like\nthey always had while I cowered away in my room, waiting for the figurative\nstorm to pass, but it never did. Instead, it was brought to me—again.\" Akir's\neyes swirled with spite as his claws gouged the rocky surface beneath them.\nBlade squeezed his paw comfortingly, but Akir didn't seem fazed.\n\n\"Apparently I had eaten too much food that night, so they beat me. It was a\nregular occurrence ever since I hatched, and I was used to it. It was never\nenough to kill me, but it hurt... a lot... I—\" Akir choked up and turned his\nhead away. Blade immediately nuzzled and comforted Akir with a soft warble.\n\n\"Th- Thanks, Blade... I limped away that night into the pouring rain. I\nremembered the pain I felt... I always remembered. I didn't make it very far,\nand I ended up climbing into a crate of rice sacks to rest for the night. As\nlong as I was away from them, I didn't care where I slept. I curled up there,\nexhausted beyond belief, and when I woke up, I was rocking uneasily. There was a\nlid over the crate, and I was too weak to open it. For nearly a week, I stayed\nin that rocking crate. It never stopped rocking. I vomited even after I had\nnothing left to puke up.\" Akir's muzzle contorted into a grimace.\n\n\"But... it wasn't the most miserable I had been. I realized not too long after\nthat I was on a ship in the middle of the sea. I could smell the salt in the\nocean breeze, and I heard the crewmen shouting things that I didn't really\nunderstand, but it all made sense. It filled me with relief.\" Akir sniffled and\nnuzzled Blade firmly.\n\n\"So you weren't born here? You're from across the sea?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I don't remember much of what it was like, but everything was green\nand luscious compared to here.\" Then he smiled and continued his story, \"I\nrealized that I would never have to go back home again. I realized that I was...\nfree... that I was away from my parents. It was, sadly, the happiest day of my\nlife. I was starving, disoriented, and sick, but I had never felt better.\"\n\n\"After the ship had docked, they unloaded my crate and shipped it to a merchant.\nThat merchant was really surprised to find a dying dragonet in their rice box!\"\nHe spared a chuckle and continued, \"And he was the kindest person I had met up\nto that point. He fed me for a few days until I was feeling better. I left him,\ntoo, not giving him much of a chance to even learn my name.\"\n\nA warm smile crossed his lips as he looked at Blade with large, adoring eyes.\n\"And that night I was given the chance to return the same kindness given to me.\nAlthough, my dragonet has stayed with me for far longer than a few days!\"\n\nBlade grinned toothily and firmly gripped Akir's paw. \"And I won't ever leave\nyou.\" After listening to Akir's past, Blade felt terribly sorry for his mate. He\nalso had an entire new outlook and understanding about Akir's life. He had never\nliked authority, and Blade could see clearly why that was. His parents had left\nhim scarred both physically and mentally, Blade realized.\n\nThere were a few scars along Akir's back where his scales were missing and some\naround his shoulders. They were thin and pink, exposing his flesh beneath that\nnatural armor. They weren't all that noticeable either. When Blade had asked\nbefore where they had come from, Akir just shrugged and said fighting.\n\nBlade cuddled comfortingly with Akir, softly nuzzling and licking him. \"I'm\nsorry you had to go through that... I wish things could have been different for\nyou,\" he said.\n\nAkir shook his head. \"I don't, and I'm glad everything happened the way it had.\"\n\nBlade stared at Akir with a look of shock. \"W- Why? That sounds terrible...\"\n\nAkir laughed brightly. \"Because I wouldn't have ever met you, Blade.\" Akir's\nbeautiful, blue spheres swirled as they met Blade's wide, golden eyes. \"I'm glad\nthose things happened to give me the opportunity to be with you. I'd suffer\nthrough all of that again and more if it meant that I could stay with you.\nThankfully, I don't have to!\"\n\nBlade wanted to scream his joy. He had never felt so many joyful emotions\ncoursing through him before. Tears wetted his eyes as he tried to blink them\naway. His heart thudded deeply inside his chest and his body could hardly sit\nstill. Their twined tails swayed back and forth as Blade moved them\nunintentionally. He mouthed at words but couldn't seem to find any. So, Akir\nleaned forward and pressed their lips together.\n\nBlade gasped softly and spread his maw open as Akir's tongue pushed inside.\nTheir maws locked while their tongues grappled and their saliva mixed. Blade\nclosed his eyes and delved deeply into the kiss. They kissed passionately,\nsharing their love intimately.\n\nAs they kissed, Akir slowly started to roll Blade onto his back and shift over\nhim. Blade's paws latched onto Akir's shoulders as he joined him belly to belly.\nBlue scales met gold feathers as Akir asserted himself on top of Blade. Blade's\nhind legs held Akir between his thighs as their hips pressed together and their\ntails coiled.\n\nA heated blush warmed Blade's cheeks as he felt Akir's nethers touching his own.\nHe couldn't hold back the soft moans that escaped his lips as they kissed. Akir\nheld the back of Blade's head while Blade held his neck, stroking up and down\nit.\n\nHis arousal set in quickly, and he could tell Akir's was too. They were both\npanting and breathing heavily while they kissed. Both of them moaned their lusts\nas paws caressed and touched intimately. Akir suckled on Blade's tongue before\nhe finally drew away. Blade opened his eyes and saw Akir's devious smirk.\n\nAnd it wasn't long before they were mating out in the open. Blade hadn't felt\ncompletely comfortable about it at first, but the pleasurable sensations and\nlusts urged him otherwise. Akir took him right there and then, making Blade moan\nand cry out his pleasure. Blade held Akir closely while their bodies rocked back\nand forth right on the edge of the cliff. Blade lay back, taking each and every\none of Akir's thrusts while their bodies mingled together passionately. To feel\nAkir's cock inside him sent Blade over the edge with bliss.\n\nThe release was fantastic, driving Blade mad with intense pleasure. Akir claimed\nhim once again, spilling his warm seed deep inside Blade's rump. Blade loved\nevery second of it, and it wasn't long before they both exhausted themselves and\nended up cuddling in the afterglow, the sight of the ocean forgotten as their\nattention focused solely on each other.\n\n* * *\n\nBlade woke up the next morning to find Akir missing from their bed. He blinked\nand sighed as he buried his head into the sheets. He hated mornings, and he\nhated waking up. Grogginess wore him down, making him want to shut his eyes and\nfind sleep again, but he forced himself to climb out of bed. His paws hit the\nground just as he heard a familiar voice that wasn't Akir's.\n\n\"Okay, just think about it! I think it would be fun, the three of us together!\nWe could make it an all-night thing, too!\"\n\nHe heard Akir chuckle. \"I'll let you know, Ves. I still need to talk to him\nabout it. You know how Blade is.\"\n\nBlade grumbled and leaned against a wall. There was no way he was going out\nthere while Vespera was around. Why was she here, anyway? He thought Akir had\nbroken off with her. He felt a slight jealous tinge, but that was easy to shy\naway. He trusted Akir more than anyone else in the world.\n\nHe then heard their door open and shut and sighed with relief. He slid through\nthe drape and found Akir walking back to him.\n\n\"Oh, you're awake! Did she wake you?\"\n\nBlade shook his head. \"No... Why was she here?\"\n\nAkir smiled and motioned for Blade to come lie with him on their furs, so he\nhappily padded on over. They lay down together side by side with Akir's wing\ndraped over Blade's back. \"I've been thinking a lot lately, Blade... about...\nabout a hatchling.\" There was some excitement in Akir's voice, a rare thing for\nBlade to hear.\n\nBlade peered at him. \"A hatchling? Like us having a hatchling?\" He never thought\nabout it until now, but he realized that he and Akir couldn't produce and\noffspring... They couldn't make eggs together, so they would never have a\nhatchling of their own. Blade felt sad about that, but it was worth it if he\ncould be with Akir.\n\nAkir scratched the back of his head and nodded. \"W- Would you like to have one?\nAn egg?\"\n\nBlade's brows furrowed. \"That's not possible...\"\n\n\"Not for us both of course but... Vespera and I were talking about having her be\nthe mother. It's almost mating season and I—well—I want us to have a hatchling\ntogether. She agreed to bear our egg under one condition...\"\n\nBlade's eyes lit up with the possibilities of having their own hatchling to\nraise... a hatchling to be fathers to. Warmth filled his chest as he thought\nabout it. \"W- What's the condition?\"\n\nAkir chuckled and nudged Blade's snout. \"That we both mate with her at the same\ntime.\"\n\nBlade blushed deeply. He hadn't thought about that. One of them would have to\nmate with her so she could bear an egg. He didn't like that idea at all! It felt\nlike they would be breaking a vow or something, and Blade was very fond of\nkeeping Akir to himself.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking, but it's a one-time thing, Blade. Don't you want a\nhatchling?\" Again, Blade could hear the excitement brimming in Akir's voice. He\ncouldn't say no to that.\n\nBlade nodded and exposed a small grin to Akir. \"With you, more than anything...\nBut I wish we didn't have to bring her into it.\"\n\nAkir nuzzled Blade comfortingly. \"I understand, Blade, but this is our only real\nchance right now. We could try to find another female, but I trust Vespera.\"\n\nBlade sighed and looked into Akir's eyes. He saw a whole lot of hope and\npleading in them. He grinned toothily and dipped his head. \"Okay, fine.\"\n\nAkir licked Blade's nose affectionately and hugged him tightly with his wing.\n\"This means a lot to me. Thank you!\"\n\nBlade giggled and scrunched his face as Akir's slimy tongue tickled him. It made\nBlade nervous to think about being a father, but it also made him super excited.\nIt was going to be a big step for them as mates, and he was more than happy to\ntake it. He just had to disregard the fact that they would be mating with\nVespera!"
