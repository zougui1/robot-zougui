Giant pillars of dark-gray clouds came from over the sea and swept the\nsand in the air with some powerful gales that ripped through the streets,\nfollowed by torrents of heavy rain. Blade, a dragon hatchling not even a year\nold, cowered beneath an abandoned cart, trembling and whimpering. His feathers\nwere soaked, he was cold, and he was starving.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">His parents had abandoned him not long after he was born&#8212;a\ndeath sentence for a feral hatchling in this city. If natural causes didn't\nkill him, the two-legs would. For months, Blade had clung to life by dodging\nthe two-legs that he could and scrounging by on the barest necessities, but his\nluck was soon coming to an end.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade curled up in the tightest little ball he could to keep\nwarm, but with it being the middle of the night, the desert's air was almost\nfrigid. The city's sandstone walls and buildings hardly provided any protection\nfor the strong gusts of wind that battered him beneath the cart. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">His black and gold feathers were unkempt, matted, and strewn\nabout every direction. What were once bright, golden eyes were now dull, yellow\nspheres with little to no life left in them. His gaunt body looked grotesque,\nespecially now that his fluffy feathers were wetted down.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade weakly looked around from under the cart. There were\nstill some legs quickly ambling about up and down the street, seeming to be\nlooking for shelter. He sighed meekly and closed his eyes. His heart beat\nfaintly in his chest, and his head swam with a dull, icy pain. His limbs were\nnumb, and he wasn't able to feel anything. Even he knew he was about to die.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He heard footsteps approaching close to his cart, so he\nglanced at them. He saw four small, blue, dragon legs walking past, seeming to\nbe struggling against the wind. One paw was different from the rest; it was\npainted purple instead of blue. Those legs belonged to a male dragonet not much\nolder than him. Blade immediately recognized that as a friendly dragon that\ncould help him, but his squeak died in his throat and he quietly wheezed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The paws stopped. Blade tried to squeak again, but he\ncouldn't get it out. Then a blue head peeked down below the cart to his side.\nBright, blue eyes that seemed to glow in the darkness studied him curiously.\nBlade turned his head and tried to reach out to the young dragonet, but he\nturned and quickly padded away. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Fear gripped Blade and he felt tears streaming down his\ncheeks. That was his last chance to survive... He shivered and sobbed until he\ncouldn't anymore. He didn't want to die. His eyes felt heavier and heavier. He\ntried to fight it. He tried to fight death.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But Blade lost.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wasn't sure how much time had truly passed, but when\nhe opened his eyes again, he was wrapped in scraps and rags stitched together\nto make a blanket. Behind him was that blue and purple dragonet holding him\nclosely against his warm body, his delicate, purple wings lain over his flanks.\nBlade didn't understand why he came back, but he couldn't have been more elated.\nHis eyes languidly drifted closed again.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">This time when he woke, the dragonet was gone, but he left\nthe blanket for Blade. The rain had stopped, and the bright sun was rising over\nthe eastern horizon, bringing warmth back to the land. Blade's stomach ached\nand growled painfully as the scent of raw meat wafted into his nostrils. He\nwinced and groaned, clutching his stomach until the pain subsided.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then he saw a hunk of meat just a few inches away from him. He\ndidn't even question it. He scrambled for it and ravenously devoured every bit\nof it, even the sand stuck to the flesh. It was the best meal he had ever had!\nWhen Blade had finished, he flopped onto his back and sighed with satisfaction.\nAlready, he could feel the life flowing back into him. He became more alert,\nand his eyes started to search for the dragonet that had saved his life. He\nwanted to thank him somehow. Even though he couldn't even speak properly, he\nknew that it was the proper thing to do. He was grateful. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But to his dismay, that mysterious dragonet was nowhere to\nbe seen. Blade sighed and stayed there for another hour or two, hoping that he\nwould show up again. It wasn't long before Blade realized how thirsty he was.\nHis mouth was as dry as the sand. He finally stood up, his limbs shaking a bit\nbefore he regained his balance, and started walking. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Not gonna thank me?\" a small voice said behind him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade whirled around and saw that blue and purple dragonet\npeering at him from inside the cart. He leaned over the edge as he stood up on\nhis hind legs. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A giant, toothy grin spread Blade's lips, and his\ngolden-feathered crest between his nubby horns flared awkwardly&#8212;he didn't have\nvery good control over it yet. He squeaked happily and immediately climbed up\ninto the cart with him. He struggled to find latches for his claws, but he\nascended it in no time.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"H- Hey... I no say you come up here,\" the dragonet protested,\nbut Blade didn't care. He hugged the him tightly, wrapping his wings around\nhim. The dragonet squeaked, but he didn't fight the embrace. Instead, he\nlightly hugged Blade back, seeming to be glad that Blade was still alive.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">That was how Blade met Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><hr /><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade ran as fast as his little legs could carry him through\nthe crowded streets, carrying a large fish almost as big as his body between\nhis teeth. He ducked beneath stalls, weaved around people's knees as they\nambled about, and took as many turns around corners as he could to escape the\nevil fishmonger. For the fat, tub of\nlard he was, he sure could run fast!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade swerved around another corner and nearly dropped his\nprized fish, but he managed to hold to it on until his white claws sunk into\nthe ground and caught his balance. He huffed and squeaked to himself as\nencouragement to propel his tiny, feathered body forward until he was at\nfull-sprint again, bounding down the next dusty street. He heard the fat man\nyelling at him to stop, but that was the last thing he would do! His paws\npadded quickly against the sandy street, kicking up the loose sand as he\nscrambled.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After another turn into an alley, Blade was sure that he\nlost the persistent cart-owner. He glanced behind him to see if he was still\nbeing followed and quickly confirmed that he wasn't. <i>Thump!</i></span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade meeped as he crashed into a sandstone wall. He\ngrumbled and rubbed his snout; his nose ached painfully. He shook his head and\nblinked to get rid of the tears before grabbing his fish. He was about to\neagerly dig into his meal, but then he heard someone coming up behind him. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He squeaked again. It was the fat man! He stroked his long,\nstraggly beard with a menacing grin curling his stupid, human lips. Blade's\nhead and eyes darted back and forth, looking for an escape, but the man blocked\nhis path completely. The little dragonet back up against the wall while hugging\nhis fish protectively.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You thought you could get away with stealing my fish, you\nlittle rat?\"</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><br /></span>\n</p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I not rat!\" Blade growled viciously... or so he thought, but\nthe man found his retort rather humorous. Blade flashed him his sharp, tiny\nteeth threateningly and flared his golden-feathered crest at the top of his\nhead between his two stubby horns. \"I dragon!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The man laughed and stepped toward Blade intimidatingly,\nlike a monster looking to prey on the weak. The black-feathered dragonet was\nonly about as tall as the man's thighs... maybe if he aimed well, he could strike\na very sensitive spot...</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But then a scarier roar sounded from above Blade. A young,\nblue and purple scaled dragon hopped down from the rooftop and landed between\nthe dragonet and the man. He elicited a vicious, bloodcurdling growl. His tail\nflicked side to side as he stared the man down and soon scared him away. The\nyoung dragon was twice Blade's size, so he was twice as terrifying! The man\nturned and ran like a scared mutt with its tail tucked between its legs.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Akir!\" Blade shouted happily and ran up to his life-long friend.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But Akir whipped around and snapped his teeth at Blade.\n\"What are you doing!?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade meeped and shrunk back with a guilty expression. \"N-\nNothin'...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir growled at him and plucked the fish from his claws.\n\"Nothing? Then why was the fishmonger chasing after you?\" he hissed and dangled\nthe fish in front of Blade, waving it back and forth.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade squeaked and reached for his fish, but a terse growl\nmade him retract his arms. \"I- Is that a ray...tor...ical qu- question?\" he asked,\ntrying to use the new word Akir taught him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir sighed and nodded. \"I told you not to be stealing!\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade pawed at the ground and felt like crying, but he\ndidn't want to in front of Akir. He wanted to be strong, so he had to act\nstrong! He sniffled and shrugged his wings. \"I hungry... and you hungry... I- I\njust wanna help.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir sighed again and shook his head disapprovingly. \"You\nlet me take care of that...\" His stern expression softened as he saw Blade wipe\naway some of his tears. He gave the fish back to the little dragonet along with\na kind nuzzle. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Besides, if you're out here, then who's the big, strong\ndragon guarding our home?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wiggled happily and hugged the large fish against his\nbody again, smiling toothily at Akir with large, golden eyes. \"I hurry back!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir smiled at Blade and licked his nose. \"I'll take us\nback. Hold on to your fish! After all that, it'd be a terrible shame if you\ndropped it.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade squeaked excitedly and nodded, holding as tightly as\nhe could to his prize. Akir picked him up and tucked him to his chest with one\npaw while he used the other three to sprint out of the alley and leap into the\nsky. After all that excitement, he could feel his tiny heart fluttering in his\nchest. He felt much safer with Akir, even if they were hundreds of feet in the\nair!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had always been the smaller dragon out of the two\nsince he was about a year or two younger than Akir. When they had first met,\nAkir had already been living on the streets for almost a full year. He, too, had\nbeen orphaned at a young age before he had met Blade, though he'd never told\nBlade what happened to his parents. Anytime Blade would ask, Akir would get\ndepressed and shy him away, so he decided it wasn't worth knowing.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir took Blade in and took as good of care of him as he\ncould in the given conditions. Since that fateful, stormy night, Akir was\nBlade's older brother. Blade wanted nothing more than to be like his purple and\nblue scaled friend, but Akir didn't want Blade to follow in his pawsteps. Akir\nwas a thief and moreso a bandit as he grew older. He stole to take care of\nhimself and Blade, supplying them with what he could. As Blade grew up with\nhim, he picked up a few things he wasn't supposed to.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">It wasn't until many years later that Akir finally accepted\nBlade's role. Blade was old enough and mature enough to understand what it\nmeant to steal. He knew what the consequences were, especially for a feral\ndragon living in a two-leg city&#8212;death. So, Akir decided to teach him so he\nwouldn't get caught.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sat on his haunches next to Akir. They were across\nfrom a similar fish stall that Blade had stolen from when he was younger, but\nthe man selling the fish was skinnier and had a darker skin-tone. He stood in\nfront of his cart of silver fish, looking for a customer. Crowds of mixed races\nand species walked between them and their target. It was the busiest time of\nday in the market district; everyone was out either selling or buying. It was\nalso the hottest time of day when the hot sun beamed down from directly\noverhead.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Stealing is a lot harder now that we're older and bigger,\"\nAkir said. \"But it's still a lot easier with two of us. Remember the plan?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded affirmatively and bared a small smile. \"You\ndistract him and I steal some fish?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"As much as you can fit into that satchel of yours,\" Akir\nfinished.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade patted his ragged leather satchel at his left flank as\nif to make sure it was still there. Akir had one similar, but his was much\nnicer. Instead of finding it in the trash like Blade had, he had stolen it from\na rather wealthy two-leg.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir looked back at Blade as he stepped forward to see if he\nwas ready. Blade nodded and they split apart; Akir stepped up to the fishmonger\nwhile Blade circled around behind him. Blade waited until the trader turned his\nback to him and then quickly padded up behind the cart. There were other\nmerchants around, but they were too busy with their own products to notice a\nthieving pair of dragons. That, and the crowd was a good cover. Even they were\ntoo busy to notice them!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Hello there,\" the man said to Akir. \"Would you like to\npurchase one of my fine fish?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir nodded and kept his attention focused on the fishmonger\nso he wouldn't reveal Blade's position. Blade stood up on his hind legs and\nquickly started plucking fish from the cart and putting them in his satchel\nwhile keeping a close eye on the man. The man turned around to gesture to his\ncart, so Blade instantly ducked behind it. He pulled his tail in too, realizing\nthat it was poking out.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"How much do your fish cost?\" Akir asked, drawing away the\ntrader's attention. Blade immediately sprung back up to grab some more. He\nslipped them into his satchel, grimacing a bit because they felt very slimy.\nHe'd have to clean his satchel really well after this!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Five silvers apiece,\" the merchant replied. \"But I know how\nyou dragons love your fish, so I'll give you a deal: three fish for ten\nsilvers!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade was surprised. That was actually a very fair deal, and\nthis man seemed to be rather friendly to Akir. He stopped as his claws twitched\nuncertainly. An unsettling feeling filled his stomach, so he backed off,\ndeciding that he had taken enough. He felt bad for stealing from this man, seeing\nhow he was one of the few people who at least pretended to be nice to a feral\ndragon. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He slipped away back to the other side of the street. He\nweaved through the crowd and made sure that his tail didn't get stepped on. He\nwatched as Akir took the deal and bought three fish. He bared a friendly smile\nat the man and handed him some silver coins from his satchel. With the fish in\nhis paw, he walked away and rejoined Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Here,\" he said and dropped the fish in Blade's bag. \"Since\nyou didn't fill your satchel.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade frowned. He knew he disappointed Akir, and he felt\nrather bad about it, but he already felt bad for stealing so many fish from\nsomeone who didn't deserve to be stolen from. \"S- Sorry, Akir...\" His head\ndrooped along with his wings.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir sighed and nudged Blade with his purple snout. \"It's\nokay, Blade. We have enough to last us several days.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded. Akir turned and started to walk along the side\nof the street with Blade following behind him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why didn't you take as many as I told you? He was probably\nthe easiest merchant I've ever distracted.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrugged his wings. \"He seemed nice. I felt... bad for\nstealing from him. It's a lot easier when they're mean.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir glanced back at Blade and flashed him a smile. He shook\nhis head with disbelief. \"He's a human, Blade. He'll be fine missing a few\nfish.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">They turned into a large street that didn't have very many\npeople walking in it. It was much easier to take to the skies here, where they\nwouldn't accidentally hit someone or buffet a crowd with their wings. They\nleapt into the air and unfurled their wings as they flapped them to gain\naltitude until they were high enough to level off and partially glide. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I know,\" Blade continued, \"But what if that was the fish he\nwas going to feed his family?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir scowled. \"They can go hungry for a day then. We've been\nthrough worse.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and nodded, deciding to drop the subject.\nInstead, he peered down at the city below while they flew home.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The desert city was settled in along the coast of a great\nsea. Blade had no idea what was on the other side of the horizon, but he\nfantasized about it sometimes. He heard rumors and such about forests,\nmountains, grass, and all sorts of plants and flowers that he rarely saw. There\nwas little to no green in the city; the only place he could think to find it\nwas the palace district where they had actual gardens that could survive the\ndesert heat and dust.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">There were many districts to the city that divided it up to\nkeep everyone happy. The main issues were the housing districts. Segregation\nwas enforced strongly; the poor were to be housed away from the rich. And all\nof the ferals lived together in one district, which was known to be the poorest\ndistrict. There weren't nearly as many four-legs as there were two-legs&#8212;they\nwere almost outnumbered ten to one! </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade and Akir never really had a home anyway. They often\nfound themselves finding new places to sleep at each night, but sometimes they\nwould come across a place they could stay for a few months until someone caught\nthem and forced them out. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">This time around, they were staying in the sewers just\noutside of town that used to drain into the sea. It wasn't used anymore&#8212;that or\nit was clogged up enough that nothing would drain out of it! It was probably\nthe safest home they had had in a long while, since no one could find them. But\nit was also the smelliest home they ever had. Blade could hardly stand it, and\nhe would sometimes sleep outside just to clear his head. Even though Akir\nalways made fun of him for it, Blade would often wake up to find Akir's\ncomfortable warmth against him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">For the next several years, they had a weekly routine. They\nwould steal together, and it would be a different stall each week. Akir was\nsmart; he devised a rotation they could follow that would keep them from\ngetting caught. One day every week or two they would slice away a few coinbags\nfrom people who looked like they could spend less money. That way they had some\nmoney to honestly buy stuff too, though they still had to steal enough to\nsustain them off that meager amount of coin.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">So, they used the money to buy a thing or two from the stall\nthey were stealing. That way they would be customers and not thieves&#8212;as far as\nthe merchant would know, anyway! Food was easy to come by that way, but water\nwas a bit riskier.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Water was hard to come by without a home. Most homes had a\nplace to store drinking water for weeks, but since they didn't live in a home,\nthey had to steal some nearly every day. Lucky for them, Akir had found where a\nlot of the richer houses store their water. They kept a large container of\nsorts in their backyards. All they had to do was drop by, fill up a few of\ntheir flasks and canisters, and fly off.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade and Akir worked together really well. Their bond was strong like real siblings, so\nthey rarely went off on their own. They were both very experienced with the\ncity, knowing its familiar layout from the sky and from the ground.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Even so, Akir always felt uneasy letting Blade go off on his\nown. He thought Blade would end up in the prisons or worse&#8212;dead. He was\nover-protective at times, as Blade had told him, so they split up one night in\nsearch of food. Blade was excited to go off on his own, but at the same time he\nfelt rather nervous.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wandered around through the dusty backstreets, looking\nfor a bit of food anywhere to satisfy his complaining stomach. He and Akir\ndidn't have much luck today in stealing their food. The merchant had caught\nthem, so they flew off before they could be arrested or beaten. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The sun was hanging in the western horizon, casting an\norange glow over the desert city. The smell of the salty sea was strong in\nBlade's nostrils since he was just a few blocks away from the harbor district.\nHe sifted through some collected trash, but he couldn't find anything edible.\nBeing the young dragon that he was, he wasn't aware that he was walking into\ndangerous territory. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Any other day, he would have recognized the signs sooner. He\nwas walking through the slums of the east housing district, a district that\nhoused two-legs of all sorts, but of the poor variety. Akir had always warned\nhim to stay away from this area, as the racial tension between those who walked\non two legs and those who walked on four legs was intense. Although they were\nsentient, the four-legged beasts were no greater than animals in their eyes.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's hunger had distracted him from his surroundings, and\nhe hadn't realized that there were a few malicious individuals following him\namongst the dappled crowds. With the hot sun about to set, Blade was about to\ncall it a day and go see if Akir had found any food for them, but a two-legged\ndragon stepped out of the shadows and in front of Blade, carrying a large\nclub-like weapon. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">In an instant, Blade turned and darted away and tried to\nleap for the skies, but a large net suddenly descended over him. He yelped and\nthrashed as it caught him, overthrowing the two attackers that tried to hold\nhim down. But before he could escape the net, a club bashed his right wing, and\na blade sliced his thigh open. Blade cried out and felt a very sharp and\npainful jolt course through his body, and his wing went numb soon after. Warm\nblood oozed down his hind leg, trickling crimson drops onto the ground. He\nlunged and swiped at another attacker, but the net caught him and he tripped\nand fell to the sandy ground.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade groaned meekly. He had little to no energy left\nalready, and the pain was even more of a deterrent, but he climbed to his paws\nonly to be bashed on the head. His head swam with stars, and he fell again.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Stay down, beast!\" the leader shouted. Blade winced and\ntried to stand again, so he was put right back in his place after the club most\nlikely broke his forearm as it swept him off of his feet. His satchel&#8212;emptier\nthan his stomach&#8212;was ripped from him, and the assailants took off, leaving the\nfeathered dragon moaning his pain in the dirt. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Around him were onlookers who didn't care to help a feral.\nThey were only interested in what happened. Blade even saw a human guard, a\nprotector of the city, pass without giving him a second thought.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade struggled to get the net off and tried to climb to his\npaws, but he yelped as an intense pain shot through his right forearm and his\nleft hind leg. He caught himself with his other legs and began to limp. He\ncouldn't walk on his one forearm, and he had to gingerly step with his bleeding\nhind leg. He could feel the blood caked on his soiled feathers already. Blade\nhissed and winced, trying to see through tear-soaked eyes. Each step was just\nas excruciating as the last.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then, from the midst of the waning crowd, a kind soul came\nto help Blade. She was a green-scaled dragonkin wearing rags for clothing, but\nshe had worried, yellow eyes. She made him stop so she could inspect his\ninjuries.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What do you want?\" Blade grumbled harshly. He recoiled as\nshe touched his limp forearm.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"To help you, stupid.\" She had a bit of a raspy voice, a\nsign that she was much older than him. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wanted to shove her away, but he gave her a chance.\n\"Come with me,\" she said. He shook his head.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I need to get back to my brother.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You'll die if&#8212;\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I need my brother!\" he shouted.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She whapped him harshly on the snout, making his tears\nreturn in an instant. \"You <i>need</i> to\ncome with me!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade glared at her and made no indication whether or not he\nwould agree. Still, she yanked him by the horns against his will and pulled him\nall the way to her home, which wasn't all that far. After a turn or two,\ndelving even deeper into the backstreets of the east housing district, they had\narrived. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">By then, Blade's legs were wobbly, his mind was hazy, and he\nfelt about ready to pass out. She had him climb up onto a large, wooden table\nthat she cleared completely off before he could lie down and rest.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Wha- ... What are y- you gonna do to me?\" He watched her open\na drawer and pull out all sorts of menacing looking tools.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm going to fix you.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Why?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She never replied. He probably wouldn't have understood her,\nanyway. His vision began to blur before he suddenly slipped away. He heard her\nshout at him, but his last thoughts were of Akir.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">When he opened his eyes again, he saw Akir's terrified and\nworried face. At first, Blade thought he had been dreaming, but the pain in his\nbody made him think otherwise. He groaned, and Akir immediately nosed at him\nand licked his face.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade was still lying on his side on top of the table, but\nhis body was all bandaged up. His feathers were terribly dirty, dusty, mangled,\nand bloodied, but he was alive... for now.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Blade...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade looked up at Akir, seeing his soft, sapphire eyes\nstaring back. He bared a weak, toothy grin and tried to chuckle, but he ended\nup coughing instead, which immediately sparked more worry from Akir. Blade had\nnever seen him so anxious before.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I- I'm fine,\" he croaked.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"<i>You are not fine</i>!\"\nAkir hissed. \"You nearly died!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and tried to move around a bit. Pain\nimmediately urged him otherwise, sending daggers through his body. Still, he\nmanaged to roll over, and with Akir's help, he stepped off of the table... only\nto collapse onto his belly with a pained yelp. His limbs were almost completely\nnumb and they were trembling violently.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I told you not to let him move,\" the old dragonkin mumbled\nfrom across the room. \"He lost a lot of blood.\" She sat back in a wooden chair,\ndressed worn, linen clothing. Her green scales were dull with age, but Blade\nthought she still looked pretty. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade struggled to his paws, and with Akir's help he was\nsoon able to stand while leaning against the blue and purple dragon. They\nturned together to face the green-scaled two-leg as she was mixing something in\na bowl. Whatever it was, Blade could smell it from several steps away, and it\nwas foul!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He looked around, noticing a lot of knick-knacks, tools,\ndecorations, and more furniture than necessary around the house. The house\nwould have been a lot larger if it wasn't for all of the stuff strewn about\nacross cabinets, tables, dressers, shelves, and whatever else she had in the\nother rooms. Aside from the smelly mixture, the house didn't smell bad... just\nold. It was constructed out of wood&#8212;a somewhat rare resource in the desert city\nsince the only supply came from across the sea. But the wood looked rather\nrotted, and he noticed a few holes where it had crumbled away.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Who a- are you?\" Blade asked weakly, returning his\nattention to her.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Tsk. Not even a thank you for saving your life?\" she\nresponded without even glancing up.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir growled in his throat. \"He asked a question.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"He certainly did,\" she tersely replied.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Silence.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Are you going to answer him?\" Akir hissed. Blade shot him\nan uneasy look. She did save his life after all... Why would Akir be so rude to\nher?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The lady added in some spices without giving them a second\nthought. Blade had to nip at Akir before he got too angry.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Hey!\" he snarled.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Then she finally looked up at him heedlessly and flicked an\near at him. \"Sorry?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Th- Thank you for saving me,\" Blade hastily added before\nAkir could say anything more.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Ah, that's better.\" She acted as if she was relieved to\nhear it, but she continued stirring the contents of the bowl anyway without\nregarding Akir. Blade could tell Akir was fuming. His claws were clacking\nthreateningly across the musty, wooden floor. He tried to calm him by licking\nhis cheeks, and it worked... for a short while.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You'd think that having saved your brother's life would\nentitle me to some respect,\" she mocked coldly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">If Blade hadn't been leaning against Akir, he probably would\nhave bolted after her.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Though I doubt you two are actually brothers, seeing how\none of you has feathers. I just assumed you're the one he was murmuring about\nwhile he was passed out.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and bared a small smile. He hated conflict.\n\"He's my brother! J- Just not by blood...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Ah, I see. You two are rather close, then? That makes sense\nsince he came looking for you only a few hours after you had passed out. How\ndid you find him, Blue?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir gritted his teeth with a glare honed in on her. \"I\nfound black and gold feathers next to a trail of blood. It doesn't take a\ngenius.\" Then Blade heard and saw his black claws gouging the wood beneath his\nfeet. \"What happened to him?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">That was when Blade realized why Akir was acting so hostile.\nAll he knew was that Blade had been attacked, and his trail of blood led to\nthis house, where there was even more of his blood around the table. He must\nhave been so worried about Blade that he disregarded his rescuer entirely.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She waved her hand as if it didn't matter, which irked Akir\nimmensely, as if he wasn't irked enough!. \"Just some bandits after some coin.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Just some bandits?\" Akir growled and stamped his forepaw on\nthe floor.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nuzzled him and nodded. \"I w- was looking for food,\nand I got beat up by three of them.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Only three?\" he asked, looking at Blade curiously. He knew\nBlade was a good fighter, and being beaten up so badly by only three two-legs was\nsurprising. Even a normal four-leg would be able to take on at the very least\ntwo two-legs. They were much stronger and had sharper claws. Humans were\nscarier, though, as they usually carried weapons with them; and more often than\nnot, they carried the ones that went <i>boom</i>.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"They took me by surprise... with a net.\" He touched a bruised\npart of his skull and winced. \"And one of them had a club.\" </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"And a very sharp blade,\" she added. \"You nearly died from\nblood loss. It sliced you about an inch deep and several inches wide&#8212;just\nbarely missed an artery.\" She pointed to his stitched and bandaged rear leg.\n\"I'm going to apply this salve here soon.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade winced. \"Th- That stinky stuff? Why?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So your wound heals, stupid.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir growled disapprovingly. \"What's in it?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Herbs and remedies.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What kind?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Nothing you would know about.\" He growled again, and the\ndragoness sighed. \"Some kingsblood, bloomweed, wine, water, and a pinch of\ndragonroot.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir hissed and curled around Blade defensively. \"You're\ntrying to poison him!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"If I wanted your friend dead, he would <i>already be dead</i>, numbskull. Dragonroot isn't harmful to your kind\nin small doses. It's to help seal the wound,\" she explained rather\napathetically.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir didn't seem convinced, but he let his guard down\nanyway. The room went silent for a moment as she finished stirring the\ningredients. After that, Akir helped Blade down to his side so he could expose\nhis hind leg to her. The bandages were already soiled from what he could tell\nas she unspun them from around his leg. Deep red splotches darkened the tan\nfabric.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You never did give us your name,\" Blade said.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Talia,\" she replied.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Thanks, Talia,\" Blade said with a small smile. \"I\nappreciate what you've done for me, and&#8212;AAAAAAH!\" Blade winced and cried out as\nan intense, stinging pain coursed through his thigh. It felt as if there was a\nfire burning and melting his flesh all up and down his hind leg. Akir was\nnearly ready to attack her before Blade held a paw out to stop him. Though he\nwould never have been able to physically, it was enough for now.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's going to sting,\" she warned much too late.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade growled and clenched his teeth tightly, his tail\nbeating the floor and stirring up some dust behind him. He rode out the pain\nfor nearly an entire minute before the burning sensation subsided and was\nreplaced by a dull ache. He panted rapidly, his heart hammering in his chest.\nTears streamed from his eyes, and his claws had dug grooves in the wooden\nflooring. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Get some rest,\" she said after bandaging his leg with fresh\nlinen. \"Your wing is broken and your forearm is fractured. I don't know what\nI'm going to do about your wing... that's something I've never dealt with before,\nbut I'll get a splint ready for you in the morning.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade hadn't thought too much about the extent of his\ninjuries. He frowned and looked at Akir, trying to find some hope. He only\nreceived a concerned expression back&#8212;and that wasn't very reassuring. It was\nbad enough that Blade wouldn't be able to walk right for a while, but he had\nlost his ability to fly! He had no idea how long it would take for his wing to\nheal... if it even did. What if he could\nnever fly again?</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia led them through her stuffy and crowded house into a\nspare bedroom with an actual bed. Under any other circumstance, Blade would\nhave been overjoyed to be sleeping on an actual bed, but with the pain\nconstantly nagging at him, he could hardly enjoy it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He whined after Talia left them, and Akir immediately&#8212;but\ncarefully&#8212;hugged Blade tightly. Blade felt Akir's wings and arms wrapping around\nhim, feeling a warmth rising within him that distracted from the pain.\nFlashbacks to when they had first met raced through his mind; he remembered so\nlittle of it, but he would never forget what Akir did for him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm so sorry I wasn't there,\" Akir said, sniffling. Blade\nfelt his heart nearly break. Akir blamed himself for his mistake. It was\nprobably eating at him the whole time, but he would never have shown his true\nemotions in front of anyone other than Blade.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's my fault, Akir. You told me not to come here alone...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm so sorry, Blade,\" he mumbled and pushed his snout\nfirmly into Blade's neck. Blade felt himself start to cry. There were only a\nfew times in his life that he could remember Akir breaking down like this, and\neach of them had been a situation almost as bad as this one. Blade warbled\nsoftly and sniffled as he snuggled in against Akir. He knew that Akir cared for\nhim deeply, and now that much was obvious. Hearing the blue and purple dragon\ncrying over him... that set Blade's chest ablaze.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'll get better soon,\" he comforted. \"Promise.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">But to Blade <i>soon</i>\nfelt like an eternity. The days rolled on by slowly. The first week wasn't\nnearly as bad as the next few. He was too busy dealing with the pain to realize\nhow doing nothing all day was really taking a toll on him. When he started to\nfeel better, he was able to walk around the dusty, old house, but that was it.\nAnd even then, he had to stumble around with a splint on his forearm. He was\nstuck there. And more often than not, his only company was the cranky old\n'ness.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia was stricter than any mother Blade had ever imagined.\nHe wasn't allowed to do anything fun or even step outside. She fed him a\nspecific diet to quicken his healing process and kept fresh bandages on his\nleg. His splint on his forearm was constantly being readjusted so that it would\nremain tight. She did figure out how to fix his wing during the first week. It\nwasn't as bad of a break as she had thought at first, and it was rather easy to\nshove into place again. The pain was excruciating for a few minutes, but it abated\nand felt much better as time progressed.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Since Blade couldn't go anywhere&#8212;without the risk of being\nattacked again&#8212;he had to find things to occupy himself. With Akir gone most of\nthe time, he chatted with Talia. The more he got to know her, the more he liked\nher.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So, you two have been on your own for over a decade?\" Talia\nasked curiously while she prepared their meals.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded while trying to peer over the wooden counter to\nsee what she was doing. It was just at eye-level, making it rather difficult\nfor him to see. Just like most of his meals, there was a mixture of herbs and\nvery little meat. Blade had grown up eating what he could find, so he wasn't a\nvery picky eater&#8212;but he still didn't like vegetables!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I think I was only a couple months old when Akir found me.\nHe was an orphan too, but he's almost two years older than I am.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's no wonder neither of you two is disciplined,\" she\ngrumbled. \"That's impressive though. I'm surprised the city didn't eat you both\nup.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grinned. \"It wasn't all that hard... Akir did most of\nthe work anyway. He's always protected me and cared for me...\" His thoughts\ndrifted to his older brother, wondering what he was up to now and whether or\nnot he was okay. He had been gone all day!<br /></span>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><br /></span>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"><br /></span>\n</p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You're rather fond of that brat, aren't you?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade stamped his paws in protest. \"He's not a brat! He's\nvery kind and caring when you get to know him.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia chuckled and diced up a stalk-like vegetable that\nBlade hadn't seen before. \"He does treat you well&#8212;better than any real siblings\nI know of. You should have seen him on your first night here while you were\nunconscious. He couldn't sit still, he wouldn't stop whining, and he ignored\nanything I said, which really isn't any different from now.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A soft smile curled Blade's lips as he thought about that.\nHe felt sorry that Akir had to go through that, but it warmed his heart to know\nhow much his brother cared for him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What happened to his parents?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrugged his shoulders so he didn't hurt his wings. \"I\ndon't know... he's never told me.\" She sighed and nodded. Blade noticed her\nexpression and composure change as she slumped down a bit. \"Why do you ask?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Whatever happened must have been pretty bad... I can see it\nin his eyes.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade warbled curiously. \"You can? H- How?\" He felt a sense\nof uncertainty as he thought about what really did happen to Akir's family... He\nwondered if it had scarred him deeply. Unlike Akir, Blade didn't know his\nfamily. He didn't remember very much during his hatchling years. All he really\nremembered was that cold, rainy night when Akir saved him, and the rest was a\nblur up until he was a dragonet.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had always wondered about his parents: who they were,\nwhat they looked like, where they were. But he mostly wondered why they had\nabandoned him. Surely there must have been a good reason... but Akir always told\nhim not to think or worry about it. They were gone.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"It's something you pick up as you get older,\" she replied.\n\"You see a lot of injured people when you're a healer, and sometimes you know\nthat there are wounds you just can't heal.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and worried even more about Akir. \"C- Can you\nteach me how to see that stuff?\" He thought that having that sort of knowledge\nwould be useful. He liked talking to people and understanding them, so being\nable to read them better would be very useful!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia glanced at him thoughtfully. \"I don't know. You don't\nseem all that stupid, I suppose,\" she teased. \"But it's something that will take\nyears to learn, and even longer to understand what you're seeing.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'm really smart! I learn things quickly, according to\nAkir,\" he said and nodded as if to assure her it was true.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"We'll see where it goes.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade wiggled happily. \"I'll do my best!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">For the next month or two, Talia taught Blade a lot about\nhow people work: their expressions, body language, emotions, and how to read\nall of that. It wasn't too hard for Blade to pick up on, but he didn't have the\nchance to see how other species are different. Although he and Talia were\nanatomically different, they were both still dragons. It was very easy to read\nher basic expressions.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">She also taught him about how the world works. Blade never\nrealized all of the little intricacies that occurred in everyday life, and she\nopened his eyes to a lot of it. And listening to all of it made him very eager\nto get out of there!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After nearly two months had passed, Blade's wing had healed.\nHe and Akir went to test his wing outside the city wall. Talia's house was\nrather close to it, so all they had to do was hop on top of the roofs and onto\nthe wall before they could glide down on the other side of it.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade climbed into the air and extended his wings fully as\nhe glided in a circle. He felt the warm sun at his back, making his\noutstretched wings feel like they were glowing. The wind brushed against his\nsleek feathers and pinned them to his body.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had never missed flying so much in his life! He soared\nhigh in the air and did a few twirls and flips. It didn't hurt, but it did feel\na little uncomfortable if he had to strain his healed wing. Still, Blade\ncouldn't have been happier, and Akir seemed to share in his happiness.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Even after Blade had fully healed, the duo stayed at Talia's\nhome. She knew they needed a place to stay, and she enjoyed the company, even\nif she and Akir didn't get along well. Akir was too proud and arrogant, and\nTalia wasn't one to respect that. Not that she really respected Blade, either,\nbut she treated him better.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Talia continued to teach him all sorts of things while Akir\nwas away. When he wasn't, they played together, wrestled with each other, or\nwalked around the city, side by side. They never stole much together anymore;\nAkir did that on his trips. They didn't have much reason to steal, now that\nthey had Talia's company, but Akir sometimes brought back more supplies for\nTalia as well as food for all of them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">For a few months, Blade <i>begged</i>\nAkir to take him along with him when he went out during his trips. Akir always\nsaid <i>no</i> and that it was <i>too dangerous</i>, which made Blade feel\nvery insignificant. Ever since that incident, he was even more protective of\nhis younger brother&#8212;Blade never thought he could get worse! Blade finally\nconvinced him one day, and he was overjoyed to hear that it was a <i>mission</i>&#8212;a well-paying one. He didn't\nreally know what that meant, but he was super excited!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade followed behind Akir, who confidently stepped around\nlike he owned the place, through the market district of the city. It seemed\nthat the older Akir got, the more arrogant he became, or as he liked to put it,\n<i>confident.</i></span> </p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade always felt a lot safer with his older brother. The\nprying eyes of the two-legs could almost be felt stabbing into his soul. Blade\nnever felt safe alone anymore, and admittedly the two-legs were a little more\nfrightening than he once thought.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Very few times were the two-legs kind to him; Talia was the\nonly nice one he had met. The humans were typically the worst&#8212;they were a bunch\nof uppity pricks&#8212;but even the dragons, gryphons, wolves, felines, rodents, and\nwhoever else that were evolved beasts were also disrespectful to their\nfour-legged brethren. In spite of sharing similar appearances, the ferals were\noutcast to the very outskirts of town to live in segregation in their own\ndistrict.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade tried his best to greet some of the friendlier looking\ntwo-legs that watched him and Akir walk past. Despite being relatively kind to\neveryone he met, Blade was received with stares, glares, and even threats. It\nwasn't like they were the only ferals walking around, either. The market\ndistrict was mixed with ferals and two-legs of all species. Despite Talia's\nteachings, Blade never understood why everyone couldn't get along, but Akir\nexplained that it was just how the entire world was. Akir never seemed to mind\nbeing an outcast. Unlike Blade, he was confident in himself.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir was everything Blade wanted to be: strong, confident,\nsmart, and charismatic. He was very handsome too! His brilliant, sapphire-scaled\nhide was speckled with splotches of dark-purple that mostly gathered close to\nhis spine from his head to his tail. He was adorned with two pairs of black horns,\nthe larger and longer pair atop the other. Only one forepaw of his was painted\ndark-purple while the rest were the same color as the rest of his hide. Just\nthe tip of his snout was purple, too, from his nose to his chin.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade was a rare species as far as he could tell. There were\nvery few dragons that shared his feathered hide, as he had only ever seen a\npawful in his life, but deep down he liked feeling special!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The majority of Blade's feathered hide was a solid black,\nbut the rest was a bright gold. After his feathered crest, a golden mane of\ntiny, long, delicate feathers traced down his neck to the tip of his tail. His\nunderbelly, from the base of his neck to the tip of his tail, was covered in\ngolden feathers. They were the fluffiest at his chest, often poofing out when\nhe didn't mean for them to.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">On each of his forearms at his wrists was a pair of golden\nbracelets that looked to be painted on his feathers. The bases of his forepaws\nwere golden as well as both of his hind paws up to his thighs. His shoulders\naround his wing joints had a unique, swirly golden design etched into his black\nfeathers. It was the same around his rear end and at the top of his feathered\nwings. Speckling his black, feathered wings was the occasional golden feather\nthat stood out amongst the darkness of his hide.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir often complimented Blade on his appearance, which made\nhim feel giddy inside. It wasn't rare for Akir to make a nice comment about\nBlade, but more often than not he was too busy being worried about him. Being\nthe bigger and stronger dragon, Akir felt like he had to be the protective\nolder brother. Even now, that much was evident.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir tensed up as a column of guards entered the street a\nfew blocks ahead of them. He looked quickly back at Blade and pointed with a\nwing to an alleyway on their right. They quickly ducked in, walking single-file\nsince it wasn't wide enough for the both of them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I told you not to bring attention to us!\" Akir hissed at\nBlade, taking a left turn down another backstreet.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"You're the one flaunting yourself around!\" Blade retorted.\n\"I only said hello to some people...\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"This isn't the feral district, Blade. We need to keep on\nthe down-low; people are starting to recognize us now.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and nodded as continued to follow Akir through\na familiar path that weaved around the market district and put them closer to\nthe palace district. It was a much longer path than walking straight through\nthe streets, but it was most certainly safer hiding in the shadows. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After many years of living and stealing in the city, Blade\nand Akir had slowly accumulated an infamous reputation, though no one really knew\nit was them. Having followed Akir's plans, they kept their identities hidden\nrather well. Their disappearance for several months helped a lot to disguise\ntheir trail. The closest description they had on their wanted posters was \"two\nferal dragons.\" Even so, that put most citizens at unease, but mostly because\nthey were ferals. Ferals were always up to no good, according to any two-leg\never.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">They took another left turn, and they were soon back out on\nthe main street. Successfully, they circumvented the small column of guards and\nwere able to continue the rest of the way to the palace district's gates\nunhindered.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"So, why are we getting here so early?\" Blade asked a bit\nloudly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir glanced at him and bared a small snarl to say, <i>shut it!</i></span> </p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade shrunk back and nodded. They approached the palace\ndistrict's gates, where there were four guards posted on either side of it.\nBlade felt a little nervous, but Akir caressed his cheek reassuringly with his\ntail and flashed a smile at him. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I'll go first. Wait a few minutes and then go. I'll be\nwaiting for you.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grinned back and nodded. He casually walked over to a\nbench to sit down on and watched Akir pass the guards alone. He sat sejant on\nthe wooden bench with his tail curled around his paws. He looked around at the\ndifferent faces, snouts, and beaks mixed in with the crowd. Mostly humans\nwalked through the gate, but there were some well-dressed two-legs as well that\ncould afford to live there.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The palace district was the only district to have a wall\ncompletely separating it from the rest of the districts. Blade tried to imagine\nwhat it would be like to live there, and he wondered if it was even possible\nfor a four-leg to become rich enough to afford it. Even then, he wondered if a\nferal would be allowed live there, seeing how the majority of two-legs and\nhumans despised them.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">After waiting a few minutes, Blade walked through the gate\nand met Akir after turning around a building. Akir licked and nuzzled him, glad\nthat nothing happened. They continued on their way down a cobblestone street.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">The palace district was beautiful. There were gardens\neverywhere with plants that thrived on the water given to them by caretakers,\nbringing an explosion of color to his eyes. It was like an immediate change of\nenvironment, an oasis in the middle of a desert. The buildings were mostly\nconstructed of solid granite and marble, and the architecture was elegant. The\nactual palace where the king stayed was the largest building Blade had ever\nseen, and it was located at the very center of the city. Even from here the\nferal district it could be seen, its spires towering above the other buildings.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"This place is beautiful, Akir.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir chuckled at Blade's amusement and nodded. \"It certainly\nis. It would be a gold mine if it weren't for all of the guards around.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"I wish we could live here,\" he said wistfully.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head along with a growl of disapproval. \"I'd\nmuch rather be with my own kind than live here.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and watched as a little rodent darted up a lone\ntree. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade had rarely visited the palace district before. Ferals\nweren't very welcome here, but they surprisingly weren't outlawed, though\nflying was. There were too many incidents with break-ins, so if anyone was\ncaught flying over the district, they would be shot down. This was the district\nwhere the wealthiest families lived, mostly noble lords and ladies. Neither\nBlade nor Akir had any money to their name&#8212;at least they didn't today!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir led Blade through the back of a home that looked to be\nabandoned, and sure enough it was. They slipped in through the back, finding a\nwindow on the third story that was missing its glass. It wasn't hard for them\nto climb up the building, as it had multiple levels and roofs to jump up on.\nAnd if they really needed to, they could have flown into it, if they were\ncareful not to get spotted.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Inside, the room was left bare. Their claws clacked on the\nhardwood floor as they inspected the area half-mindedly. It was very dusty in\nhere, and it tickled Blade's nose unpleasantly.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"We couldn't have waited until later?\" Blade grumbled,\ntwitching his nose.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir shook his head. \"In about an hour, those gates will\nclose. If we're caught in this district after that, we'll probably be killed.\nWe'll wait in here until it's dark out; then we'll make our move.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"If we're waiting until it's dark, we could have flown\ndown,\" Blade offered.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Too risky. They have some sort of spell now that detects\nanything above a certain height.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade sighed and dusted off a spot for him to lie down. He\ndidn't like his feathers getting all dusty or dirty. \"This had better be worth\nit!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir grinned toothily and nuzzled Blade. He flopped down\nbeside the younger drake and nodded. \"It is! The gem we're after is worth over five-hundred\ngold pieces, and I've already got a buyer for that much.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade's ears perked up. \"Five-hundred!?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir hissed, \"Keep your voice down.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade meeped and gulped, his eyes wide. He lowered his\nvoice. \"That's a lot of money... What would we even do with it?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A warm smile curled Akir's lips. \"We're going to buy our\nfirst home!\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade grinned giddily back. They haven't had a real home\nsince... ever! The closest they've had was an abandoned mine shaft beneath the\ncity, but that had only lasted a year or two before it became too dangerous to\nlive in. Now, they lived with the old dragoness Talia. Even though it was the\nmost comfortable place they had ever stayed, it wasn't anything like having\ntheir own home!</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"What's the plan?\" he asked, eager to help out and begin\ntheir mission.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Akir pointed with a black claw at the floor in front of\nthem, pretending to be drawing a map. \"We're currently here, so we'll have to\nsneak out and make our way all the way over here,\" he said, scraping his claw\nalong the wood. \"We'll have to keep an eye out because there are four groups of\npatrolling guards for each sector of this district. We'll break in through the\nback again of a building similar to this one. There is a large garden behind\nit, so sneaking onto their property should be easy.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded and stored the information away for later. \"Do\nyou know where the gem is?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"That's the tricky part... It's in a lady's necklace that she\nwears every day. We'll probably have to break in to her bedroom, snatch the\nnecklace, and get out before they call the guards... or worse.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade gulped. \"Worse?\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"If they retaliate, try not to hurt them.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded. He and Akir may have been thieves, but they\nwere not killers.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:center;\" align=\"center\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">* * *</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">A few hours later, the sun dropped behind the horizon and\nleft the desert city in darkness. As Blade and Akir crouched down and prowled\nbriskly from house to house, cover to cover, the cool night air welcomed them.\nThey snuck passed one of the patrols and waited out the other on their way to\ntheir target.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Once they had arrived, they looked around quietly for an\neasy entrance. Blade found a window that could open on the first of two\nstories, and it was left unlocked. He picked at it with his claws, opened the\nlatch, and he squeezed in. It was too tight of a fit for Akir, so Blade circled\nback and opened the back door for him.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Unlike their hideout earlier, this house was filled with\nfurniture and decorations, many of which Blade wanted to steal. But he couldn't\nfit everything, and they were here for a specific objective anyway: the\nnecklace. They carefully padded through the house, making sure not to bump into\nor knock anything over, since it was rather cramped inside for two feral\ndragons.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Stay down here while I go up the stairs,\" Akir whispered,\n\"Look for the bedroom... and grab anything else that will fit in your satchel.\"</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded dutifully and searched around. He opened a door\nslowly and peeked inside to see if there was anyone there. He could feel his\nheart thudding in his chest until he elicited a small sigh of relief. Blade\nhated to admit it, but he was nervous. He didn't want to disappoint Akir, and\nhe didn't want to ruin the opportunity they had for a better life. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">He searched the bedroom and did happen to find a few pieces\nof jewelry lying around, though they didn't look like anything important. He\nshoved them in his satchel and moved on to the next room. This time the door\ncreaked and made Blade flinch. He peeked inside and saw a little, gryphon girl\nlying on her bed. He immediately pulled the door closed and latched the bar\nshut. He quietly stepped away and about knocked down a vase with his tail. He\nquickly whirled around to catch it and readjust it, but in that process his\ntail smacked against a wooden post and made a thud.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade\nfroze for a few moments and then sighed with relief. He shook his head and\ntried to calm his fluttering heart. Once he did, he heard a loud thud, a clash,\nand then another loud thud from upstairs. Again, Blade's heart raced, but so\ndid his legs. He rushed up the staircase and hurried after Akir. When he\nreached the top, he saw the purple and blue dragon sprinting toward him from\ndown the long hall.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\"Run! I got it!\" he shouted. </span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Blade nodded. Before he turned around, he saw a very angry,\ngryphon father chasing after them with a sword. Blade yelped and slid down the\nstairs and darted for the back door with Akir close behind. They broke free\nfrom the home, bounded out into the garden, and took off into the sky. They\nflew right over the wall, swiftly swooping over some guards, and then climbed\ninto the skies.</span></p><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">\n\n\n\n</span><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">As Blade looked behind them, he saw the house fading away as\nthey gained distance. He giggled happily and did a little twirl in the air.\nAkir grinned toothily at him and bellowed a magnificent roar that echoed\nthrough the darkness. Blade shivered at that. Rarely did he ever hear Akir\nroar, and even more rarely was it a joyful roar!</span><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\"></span></p>\n </body>\n</html>\n"

    "content": "BIG CITY THIEVES\n\nIt was the rainiest day the desert city had seen in a long while. Giant pillars\nof dark-gray clouds came from over the sea and swept the sand in the air with\nsome powerful gales that ripped through the streets, followed by torrents of\nheavy rain. Blade, a dragon hatchling not even a year old, cowered beneath an\nabandoned cart, trembling and whimpering. His feathers were soaked, he was cold,\nand he was starving.\n\nHis parents had abandoned him not long after he was born—a death sentence for a\nferal hatchling in this city. If natural causes didn't kill him, the two-legs\nwould. For months, Blade had clung to life by dodging the two-legs that he could\nand scrounging by on the barest necessities, but his luck was soon coming to an\nend.\n\nBlade curled up in the tightest little ball he could to keep warm, but with it\nbeing the middle of the night, the desert's air was almost frigid. The city's\nsandstone walls and buildings hardly provided any protection for the strong\ngusts of wind that battered him beneath the cart.\n\nHis black and gold feathers were unkempt, matted, and strewn about every\ndirection. What were once bright, golden eyes were now dull, yellow spheres with\nlittle to no life left in them. His gaunt body looked grotesque, especially now\nthat his fluffy feathers were wetted down.\n\nBlade weakly looked around from under the cart. There were still some legs\nquickly ambling about up and down the street, seeming to be looking for shelter.\nHe sighed meekly and closed his eyes. His heart beat faintly in his chest, and\nhis head swam with a dull, icy pain. His limbs were numb, and he wasn't able to\nfeel anything. Even he knew he was about to die.\n\nHe heard footsteps approaching close to his cart, so he glanced at them. He saw\nfour small, blue, dragon legs walking past, seeming to be struggling against the\nwind. One paw was different from the rest; it was painted purple instead of\nblue. Those legs belonged to a male dragonet not much older than him. Blade\nimmediately recognized that as a friendly dragon that could help him, but his\nsqueak died in his throat and he quietly wheezed.\n\nThe paws stopped. Blade tried to squeak again, but he couldn't get it out. Then\na blue head peeked down below the cart to his side. Bright, blue eyes that\nseemed to glow in the darkness studied him curiously. Blade turned his head and\ntried to reach out to the young dragonet, but he turned and quickly padded away.\n\nFear gripped Blade and he felt tears streaming down his cheeks. That was his\nlast chance to survive... He shivered and sobbed until he couldn't anymore. He\ndidn't want to die. His eyes felt heavier and heavier. He tried to fight it. He\ntried to fight death.\n\nBut Blade lost.\n\nBlade wasn't sure how much time had truly passed, but when he opened his eyes\nagain, he was wrapped in scraps and rags stitched together to make a blanket.\nBehind him was that blue and purple dragonet holding him closely against his\nwarm body, his delicate, purple wings lain over his flanks. Blade didn't\nunderstand why he came back, but he couldn't have been more elated. His eyes\nlanguidly drifted closed again.\n\nThis time when he woke, the dragonet was gone, but he left the blanket for\nBlade. The rain had stopped, and the bright sun was rising over the eastern\nhorizon, bringing warmth back to the land. Blade's stomach ached and growled\npainfully as the scent of raw meat wafted into his nostrils. He winced and\ngroaned, clutching his stomach until the pain subsided.\n\nThen he saw a hunk of meat just a few inches away from him. He didn't even\nquestion it. He scrambled for it and ravenously devoured every bit of it, even\nthe sand stuck to the flesh. It was the best meal he had ever had! When Blade\nhad finished, he flopped onto his back and sighed with satisfaction. Already, he\ncould feel the life flowing back into him. He became more alert, and his eyes\nstarted to search for the dragonet that had saved his life. He wanted to thank\nhim somehow. Even though he couldn't even speak properly, he knew that it was\nthe proper thing to do. He was grateful.\n\nBut to his dismay, that mysterious dragonet was nowhere to be seen. Blade sighed\nand stayed there for another hour or two, hoping that he would show up again. It\nwasn't long before Blade realized how thirsty he was. His mouth was as dry as\nthe sand. He finally stood up, his limbs shaking a bit before he regained his\nbalance, and started walking.\n\n\"Not gonna thank me?\" a small voice said behind him.\n\nBlade whirled around and saw that blue and purple dragonet peering at him from\ninside the cart. He leaned over the edge as he stood up on his hind legs.\n\nA giant, toothy grin spread Blade's lips, and his golden-feathered crest between\nhis nubby horns flared awkwardly—he didn't have very good control over it yet.\nHe squeaked happily and immediately climbed up into the cart with him. He\nstruggled to find latches for his claws, but he ascended it in no time.\n\n\"H- Hey... I no say you come up here,\" the dragonet protested, but Blade didn't\ncare. He hugged the him tightly, wrapping his wings around him. The dragonet\nsqueaked, but he didn't fight the embrace. Instead, he lightly hugged Blade\nback, seeming to be glad that Blade was still alive.\n\nThat was how Blade met Akir.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlade ran as fast as his little legs could carry him through the crowded\nstreets, carrying a large fish almost as big as his body between his teeth. He\nducked beneath stalls, weaved around people's knees as they ambled about, and\ntook as many turns around corners as he could to escape the evil fishmonger. For\nthe fat, tub of lard he was, he sure could run fast!\n\nBlade swerved around another corner and nearly dropped his prized fish, but he\nmanaged to hold to it on until his white claws sunk into the ground and caught\nhis balance. He huffed and squeaked to himself as encouragement to propel his\ntiny, feathered body forward until he was at full-sprint again, bounding down\nthe next dusty street. He heard the fat man yelling at him to stop, but that was\nthe last thing he would do! His paws padded quickly against the sandy street,\nkicking up the loose sand as he scrambled.\n\nAfter another turn into an alley, Blade was sure that he lost the persistent\ncart-owner. He glanced behind him to see if he was still being followed and\nquickly confirmed that he wasn't. Thump!\n\nBlade meeped as he crashed into a sandstone wall. He grumbled and rubbed his\nsnout; his nose ached painfully. He shook his head and blinked to get rid of the\ntears before grabbing his fish. He was about to eagerly dig into his meal, but\nthen he heard someone coming up behind him.\n\nHe squeaked again. It was the fat man! He stroked his long, straggly beard with\na menacing grin curling his stupid, human lips. Blade's head and eyes darted\nback and forth, looking for an escape, but the man blocked his path completely.\nThe little dragonet back up against the wall while hugging his fish\nprotectively.\n\n\"You thought you could get away with stealing my fish, you little rat?\"\n\n\n\"I not rat!\" Blade growled viciously... or so he thought, but the man found his\nretort rather humorous. Blade flashed him his sharp, tiny teeth threateningly\nand flared his golden-feathered crest at the top of his head between his two\nstubby horns. \"I dragon!\"\n\nThe man laughed and stepped toward Blade intimidatingly, like a monster looking\nto prey on the weak. The black-feathered dragonet was only about as tall as the\nman's thighs... maybe if he aimed well, he could strike a very sensitive spot...\n\nBut then a scarier roar sounded from above Blade. A young, blue and purple\nscaled dragon hopped down from the rooftop and landed between the dragonet and\nthe man. He elicited a vicious, bloodcurdling growl. His tail flicked side to\nside as he stared the man down and soon scared him away. The young dragon was\ntwice Blade's size, so he was twice as terrifying! The man turned and ran like a\nscared mutt with its tail tucked between its legs.\n\n\"Akir!\" Blade shouted happily and ran up to his life-long friend.\n\nBut Akir whipped around and snapped his teeth at Blade. \"What are you doing!?\"\n\nBlade meeped and shrunk back with a guilty expression. \"N- Nothin'...\"\n\nAkir growled at him and plucked the fish from his claws. \"Nothing? Then why was\nthe fishmonger chasing after you?\" he hissed and dangled the fish in front of\nBlade, waving it back and forth.\n\nBlade squeaked and reached for his fish, but a terse growl made him retract his\narms. \"I- Is that a ray...tor...ical qu- question?\" he asked, trying to use the\nnew word Akir taught him.\n\nAkir sighed and nodded. \"I told you not to be stealing!\"\n\nBlade pawed at the ground and felt like crying, but he didn't want to in front\nof Akir. He wanted to be strong, so he had to act strong! He sniffled and\nshrugged his wings. \"I hungry... and you hungry... I- I just wanna help.\"\n\nAkir sighed again and shook his head disapprovingly. \"You let me take care of\nthat...\" His stern expression softened as he saw Blade wipe away some of his\ntears. He gave the fish back to the little dragonet along with a kind nuzzle.\n\n\"Besides, if you're out here, then who's the big, strong dragon guarding our\nhome?\"\n\nBlade wiggled happily and hugged the large fish against his body again, smiling\ntoothily at Akir with large, golden eyes. \"I hurry back!\"\n\nAkir smiled at Blade and licked his nose. \"I'll take us back. Hold on to your\nfish! After all that, it'd be a terrible shame if you dropped it.\"\n\nBlade squeaked excitedly and nodded, holding as tightly as he could to his\nprize. Akir picked him up and tucked him to his chest with one paw while he used\nthe other three to sprint out of the alley and leap into the sky. After all that\nexcitement, he could feel his tiny heart fluttering in his chest. He felt much\nsafer with Akir, even if they were hundreds of feet in the air!\n\n* * *\n\nBlade had always been the smaller dragon out of the two since he was about a\nyear or two younger than Akir. When they had first met, Akir had already been\nliving on the streets for almost a full year. He, too, had been orphaned at a\nyoung age before he had met Blade, though he'd never told Blade what happened to\nhis parents. Anytime Blade would ask, Akir would get depressed and shy him away,\nso he decided it wasn't worth knowing.\n\nAkir took Blade in and took as good of care of him as he could in the given\nconditions. Since that fateful, stormy night, Akir was Blade's older brother.\nBlade wanted nothing more than to be like his purple and blue scaled friend, but\nAkir didn't want Blade to follow in his pawsteps. Akir was a thief and moreso a\nbandit as he grew older. He stole to take care of himself and Blade, supplying\nthem with what he could. As Blade grew up with him, he picked up a few things he\nwasn't supposed to.\n\nIt wasn't until many years later that Akir finally accepted Blade's role. Blade\nwas old enough and mature enough to understand what it meant to steal. He knew\nwhat the consequences were, especially for a feral dragon living in a two-leg\ncity—death. So, Akir decided to teach him so he wouldn't get caught.\n\nBlade sat on his haunches next to Akir. They were across from a similar fish\nstall that Blade had stolen from when he was younger, but the man selling the\nfish was skinnier and had a darker skin-tone. He stood in front of his cart of\nsilver fish, looking for a customer. Crowds of mixed races and species walked\nbetween them and their target. It was the busiest time of day in the market\ndistrict; everyone was out either selling or buying. It was also the hottest\ntime of day when the hot sun beamed down from directly overhead.\n\n\"Stealing is a lot harder now that we're older and bigger,\" Akir said. \"But it's\nstill a lot easier with two of us. Remember the plan?\"\n\nBlade nodded affirmatively and bared a small smile. \"You distract him and I\nsteal some fish?\"\n\n\"As much as you can fit into that satchel of yours,\" Akir finished.\n\nBlade patted his ragged leather satchel at his left flank as if to make sure it\nwas still there. Akir had one similar, but his was much nicer. Instead of\nfinding it in the trash like Blade had, he had stolen it from a rather wealthy\ntwo-leg.\n\nAkir looked back at Blade as he stepped forward to see if he was ready. Blade\nnodded and they split apart; Akir stepped up to the fishmonger while Blade\ncircled around behind him. Blade waited until the trader turned his back to him\nand then quickly padded up behind the cart. There were other merchants around,\nbut they were too busy with their own products to notice a thieving pair of\ndragons. That, and the crowd was a good cover. Even they were too busy to notice\nthem!\n\n\"Hello there,\" the man said to Akir. \"Would you like to purchase one of my fine\nfish?\"\n\nAkir nodded and kept his attention focused on the fishmonger so he wouldn't\nreveal Blade's position. Blade stood up on his hind legs and quickly started\nplucking fish from the cart and putting them in his satchel while keeping a\nclose eye on the man. The man turned around to gesture to his cart, so Blade\ninstantly ducked behind it. He pulled his tail in too, realizing that it was\npoking out.\n\n\"How much do your fish cost?\" Akir asked, drawing away the trader's attention.\nBlade immediately sprung back up to grab some more. He slipped them into his\nsatchel, grimacing a bit because they felt very slimy. He'd have to clean his\nsatchel really well after this!\n\n\"Five silvers apiece,\" the merchant replied. \"But I know how you dragons love\nyour fish, so I'll give you a deal: three fish for ten silvers!\"\n\nBlade was surprised. That was actually a very fair deal, and this man seemed to\nbe rather friendly to Akir. He stopped as his claws twitched uncertainly. An\nunsettling feeling filled his stomach, so he backed off, deciding that he had\ntaken enough. He felt bad for stealing from this man, seeing how he was one of\nthe few people who at least pretended to be nice to a feral dragon.\n\nHe slipped away back to the other side of the street. He weaved through the\ncrowd and made sure that his tail didn't get stepped on. He watched as Akir took\nthe deal and bought three fish. He bared a friendly smile at the man and handed\nhim some silver coins from his satchel. With the fish in his paw, he walked away\nand rejoined Blade.\n\n\"Here,\" he said and dropped the fish in Blade's bag. \"Since you didn't fill your\nsatchel.\"\n\nBlade frowned. He knew he disappointed Akir, and he felt rather bad about it,\nbut he already felt bad for stealing so many fish from someone who didn't\ndeserve to be stolen from. \"S- Sorry, Akir...\" His head drooped along with his\nwings.\n\nAkir sighed and nudged Blade with his purple snout. \"It's okay, Blade. We have\nenough to last us several days.\"\n\nBlade nodded. Akir turned and started to walk along the side of the street with\nBlade following behind him.\n\n\"Why didn't you take as many as I told you? He was probably the easiest merchant\nI've ever distracted.\"\n\nBlade shrugged his wings. \"He seemed nice. I felt... bad for stealing from him.\nIt's a lot easier when they're mean.\"\n\nAkir glanced back at Blade and flashed him a smile. He shook his head with\ndisbelief. \"He's a human, Blade. He'll be fine missing a few fish.\"\n\nThey turned into a large street that didn't have very many people walking in it.\nIt was much easier to take to the skies here, where they wouldn't accidentally\nhit someone or buffet a crowd with their wings. They leapt into the air and\nunfurled their wings as they flapped them to gain altitude until they were high\nenough to level off and partially glide.\n\n\"I know,\" Blade continued, \"But what if that was the fish he was going to feed\nhis family?\"\n\nAkir scowled. \"They can go hungry for a day then. We've been through worse.\"\n\nBlade sighed and nodded, deciding to drop the subject. Instead, he peered down\nat the city below while they flew home.\n\nThe desert city was settled in along the coast of a great sea. Blade had no idea\nwhat was on the other side of the horizon, but he fantasized about it sometimes.\nHe heard rumors and such about forests, mountains, grass, and all sorts of\nplants and flowers that he rarely saw. There was little to no green in the city;\nthe only place he could think to find it was the palace district where they had\nactual gardens that could survive the desert heat and dust.\n\nThere were many districts to the city that divided it up to keep everyone happy.\nThe main issues were the housing districts. Segregation was enforced strongly;\nthe poor were to be housed away from the rich. And all of the ferals lived\ntogether in one district, which was known to be the poorest district. There\nweren't nearly as many four-legs as there were two-legs—they were almost\noutnumbered ten to one!\n\nBlade and Akir never really had a home anyway. They often found themselves\nfinding new places to sleep at each night, but sometimes they would come across\na place they could stay for a few months until someone caught them and forced\nthem out.\n\nThis time around, they were staying in the sewers just outside of town that used\nto drain into the sea. It wasn't used anymore—that or it was clogged up enough\nthat nothing would drain out of it! It was probably the safest home they had had\nin a long while, since no one could find them. But it was also the smelliest\nhome they ever had. Blade could hardly stand it, and he would sometimes sleep\noutside just to clear his head. Even though Akir always made fun of him for it,\nBlade would often wake up to find Akir's comfortable warmth against him.\n\nFor the next several years, they had a weekly routine. They would steal\ntogether, and it would be a different stall each week. Akir was smart; he\ndevised a rotation they could follow that would keep them from getting caught.\nOne day every week or two they would slice away a few coinbags from people who\nlooked like they could spend less money. That way they had some money to\nhonestly buy stuff too, though they still had to steal enough to sustain them\noff that meager amount of coin.\n\nSo, they used the money to buy a thing or two from the stall they were stealing.\nThat way they would be customers and not thieves—as far as the merchant would\nknow, anyway! Food was easy to come by that way, but water was a bit riskier.\n\nWater was hard to come by without a home. Most homes had a place to store\ndrinking water for weeks, but since they didn't live in a home, they had to\nsteal some nearly every day. Lucky for them, Akir had found where a lot of the\nricher houses store their water. They kept a large container of sorts in their\nbackyards. All they had to do was drop by, fill up a few of their flasks and\ncanisters, and fly off.\n\nBlade and Akir worked together really well. Their bond was strong like real\nsiblings, so they rarely went off on their own. They were both very experienced\nwith the city, knowing its familiar layout from the sky and from the ground.\n\nEven so, Akir always felt uneasy letting Blade go off on his own. He thought\nBlade would end up in the prisons or worse—dead. He was over-protective at\ntimes, as Blade had told him, so they split up one night in search of food.\nBlade was excited to go off on his own, but at the same time he felt rather\nnervous.\n\nBlade wandered around through the dusty backstreets, looking for a bit of food\nanywhere to satisfy his complaining stomach. He and Akir didn't have much luck\ntoday in stealing their food. The merchant had caught them, so they flew off\nbefore they could be arrested or beaten.\n\nThe sun was hanging in the western horizon, casting an orange glow over the\ndesert city. The smell of the salty sea was strong in Blade's nostrils since he\nwas just a few blocks away from the harbor district. He sifted through some\ncollected trash, but he couldn't find anything edible. Being the young dragon\nthat he was, he wasn't aware that he was walking into dangerous territory.\n\nAny other day, he would have recognized the signs sooner. He was walking through\nthe slums of the east housing district, a district that housed two-legs of all\nsorts, but of the poor variety. Akir had always warned him to stay away from\nthis area, as the racial tension between those who walked on two legs and those\nwho walked on four legs was intense. Although they were sentient, the\nfour-legged beasts were no greater than animals in their eyes.\n\nBlade's hunger had distracted him from his surroundings, and he hadn't realized\nthat there were a few malicious individuals following him amongst the dappled\ncrowds. With the hot sun about to set, Blade was about to call it a day and go\nsee if Akir had found any food for them, but a two-legged dragon stepped out of\nthe shadows and in front of Blade, carrying a large club-like weapon.\n\nIn an instant, Blade turned and darted away and tried to leap for the skies, but\na large net suddenly descended over him. He yelped and thrashed as it caught\nhim, overthrowing the two attackers that tried to hold him down. But before he\ncould escape the net, a club bashed his right wing, and a blade sliced his thigh\nopen. Blade cried out and felt a very sharp and painful jolt course through his\nbody, and his wing went numb soon after. Warm blood oozed down his hind leg,\ntrickling crimson drops onto the ground. He lunged and swiped at another\nattacker, but the net caught him and he tripped and fell to the sandy ground.\n\nBlade groaned meekly. He had little to no energy left already, and the pain was\neven more of a deterrent, but he climbed to his paws only to be bashed on the\nhead. His head swam with stars, and he fell again.\n\n\"Stay down, beast!\" the leader shouted. Blade winced and tried to stand again,\nso he was put right back in his place after the club most likely broke his\nforearm as it swept him off of his feet. His satchel—emptier than his\nstomach—was ripped from him, and the assailants took off, leaving the feathered\ndragon moaning his pain in the dirt.\n\nAround him were onlookers who didn't care to help a feral. They were only\ninterested in what happened. Blade even saw a human guard, a protector of the\ncity, pass without giving him a second thought.\n\nBlade struggled to get the net off and tried to climb to his paws, but he yelped\nas an intense pain shot through his right forearm and his left hind leg. He\ncaught himself with his other legs and began to limp. He couldn't walk on his\none forearm, and he had to gingerly step with his bleeding hind leg. He could\nfeel the blood caked on his soiled feathers already. Blade hissed and winced,\ntrying to see through tear-soaked eyes. Each step was just as excruciating as\nthe last.\n\nThen, from the midst of the waning crowd, a kind soul came to help Blade. She\nwas a green-scaled dragonkin wearing rags for clothing, but she had worried,\nyellow eyes. She made him stop so she could inspect his injuries.\n\n\"What do you want?\" Blade grumbled harshly. He recoiled as she touched his limp\nforearm.\n\n\"To help you, stupid.\" She had a bit of a raspy voice, a sign that she was much\nolder than him.\n\nBlade wanted to shove her away, but he gave her a chance. \"Come with me,\" she\nsaid. He shook his head.\n\n\"I need to get back to my brother.\"\n\n\"You'll die if—\"\n\n\"I need my brother!\" he shouted.\n\nShe whapped him harshly on the snout, making his tears return in an instant.\n\"You need to come with me!\"\n\nBlade glared at her and made no indication whether or not he would agree. Still,\nshe yanked him by the horns against his will and pulled him all the way to her\nhome, which wasn't all that far. After a turn or two, delving even deeper into\nthe backstreets of the east housing district, they had arrived.\n\nBy then, Blade's legs were wobbly, his mind was hazy, and he felt about ready to\npass out. She had him climb up onto a large, wooden table that she cleared\ncompletely off before he could lie down and rest.\n\n\"Wha- ... What are y- you gonna do to me?\" He watched her open a drawer and pull\nout all sorts of menacing looking tools.\n\n\"I'm going to fix you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nShe never replied. He probably wouldn't have understood her, anyway. His vision\nbegan to blur before he suddenly slipped away. He heard her shout at him, but\nhis last thoughts were of Akir.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes again, he saw Akir's terrified and worried face. At\nfirst, Blade thought he had been dreaming, but the pain in his body made him\nthink otherwise. He groaned, and Akir immediately nosed at him and licked his\nface.\n\nBlade was still lying on his side on top of the table, but his body was all\nbandaged up. His feathers were terribly dirty, dusty, mangled, and bloodied, but\nhe was alive... for now.\n\n\"Blade...\"\n\nBlade looked up at Akir, seeing his soft, sapphire eyes staring back. He bared a\nweak, toothy grin and tried to chuckle, but he ended up coughing instead, which\nimmediately sparked more worry from Akir. Blade had never seen him so anxious\nbefore.\n\n\"I- I'm fine,\" he croaked.\n\n\"You are not fine!\" Akir hissed. \"You nearly died!\"\n\nBlade sighed and tried to move around a bit. Pain immediately urged him\notherwise, sending daggers through his body. Still, he managed to roll over, and\nwith Akir's help, he stepped off of the table... only to collapse onto his belly\nwith a pained yelp. His limbs were almost completely numb and they were\ntrembling violently.\n\n\"I told you not to let him move,\" the old dragonkin mumbled from across the\nroom. \"He lost a lot of blood.\" She sat back in a wooden chair, dressed worn,\nlinen clothing. Her green scales were dull with age, but Blade thought she still\nlooked pretty.\n\nBlade struggled to his paws, and with Akir's help he was soon able to stand\nwhile leaning against the blue and purple dragon. They turned together to face\nthe green-scaled two-leg as she was mixing something in a bowl. Whatever it was,\nBlade could smell it from several steps away, and it was foul!\n\nHe looked around, noticing a lot of knick-knacks, tools, decorations, and more\nfurniture than necessary around the house. The house would have been a lot\nlarger if it wasn't for all of the stuff strewn about across cabinets, tables,\ndressers, shelves, and whatever else she had in the other rooms. Aside from the\nsmelly mixture, the house didn't smell bad... just old. It was constructed out\nof wood—a somewhat rare resource in the desert city since the only supply came\nfrom across the sea. But the wood looked rather rotted, and he noticed a few\nholes where it had crumbled away.\n\n\"Who a- are you?\" Blade asked weakly, returning his attention to her.\n\n\"Tsk. Not even a thank you for saving your life?\" she responded without even\nglancing up.\n\nAkir growled in his throat. \"He asked a question.\"\n\n\"He certainly did,\" she tersely replied.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Are you going to answer him?\" Akir hissed. Blade shot him an uneasy look. She\ndid save his life after all... Why would Akir be so rude to her?\n\nThe lady added in some spices without giving them a second thought. Blade had to\nnip at Akir before he got too angry.\n\n\"Hey!\" he snarled.\n\nThen she finally looked up at him heedlessly and flicked an ear at him. \"Sorry?\"\n\n\"Th- Thank you for saving me,\" Blade hastily added before Akir could say\nanything more.\n\n\"Ah, that's better.\" She acted as if she was relieved to hear it, but she\ncontinued stirring the contents of the bowl anyway without regarding Akir. Blade\ncould tell Akir was fuming. His claws were clacking threateningly across the\nmusty, wooden floor. He tried to calm him by licking his cheeks, and it\nworked... for a short while.\n\n\"You'd think that having saved your brother's life would entitle me to some\nrespect,\" she mocked coldly.\n\nIf Blade hadn't been leaning against Akir, he probably would have bolted after\nher.\n\n\"Though I doubt you two are actually brothers, seeing how one of you has\nfeathers. I just assumed you're the one he was murmuring about while he was\npassed out.\"\n\nBlade nodded and bared a small smile. He hated conflict. \"He's my brother! J-\nJust not by blood...\"\n\n\"Ah, I see. You two are rather close, then? That makes sense since he came\nlooking for you only a few hours after you had passed out. How did you find him,\nBlue?\"\n\nAkir gritted his teeth with a glare honed in on her. \"I found black and gold\nfeathers next to a trail of blood. It doesn't take a genius.\" Then Blade heard\nand saw his black claws gouging the wood beneath his feet. \"What happened to\nhim?\"\n\nThat was when Blade realized why Akir was acting so hostile. All he knew was\nthat Blade had been attacked, and his trail of blood led to this house, where\nthere was even more of his blood around the table. He must have been so worried\nabout Blade that he disregarded his rescuer entirely.\n\nShe waved her hand as if it didn't matter, which irked Akir immensely, as if he\nwasn't irked enough!. \"Just some bandits after some coin.\"\n\n\"Just some bandits?\" Akir growled and stamped his forepaw on the floor.\n\nBlade nuzzled him and nodded. \"I w- was looking for food, and I got beat up by\nthree of them.\"\n\n\"Only three?\" he asked, looking at Blade curiously. He knew Blade was a good\nfighter, and being beaten up so badly by only three two-legs was surprising.\nEven a normal four-leg would be able to take on at the very least two two-legs.\nThey were much stronger and had sharper claws. Humans were scarier, though, as\nthey usually carried weapons with them; and more often than not, they carried\nthe ones that went boom.\n\n\"They took me by surprise... with a net.\" He touched a bruised part of his skull\nand winced. \"And one of them had a club.\"\n\n\"And a very sharp blade,\" she added. \"You nearly died from blood loss. It sliced\nyou about an inch deep and several inches wide—just barely missed an artery.\"\nShe pointed to his stitched and bandaged rear leg. \"I'm going to apply this\nsalve here soon.\"\n\nBlade winced. \"Th- That stinky stuff? Why?\"\n\n\"So your wound heals, stupid.\"\n\nAkir growled disapprovingly. \"What's in it?\"\n\n\"Herbs and remedies.\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"Nothing you would know about.\" He growled again, and the dragoness sighed.\n\"Some kingsblood, bloomweed, wine, water, and a pinch of dragonroot.\"\n\nAkir hissed and curled around Blade defensively. \"You're trying to poison him!\"\n\n\"If I wanted your friend dead, he would already be dead, numbskull. Dragonroot\nisn't harmful to your kind in small doses. It's to help seal the wound,\" she\nexplained rather apathetically.\n\nAkir didn't seem convinced, but he let his guard down anyway. The room went\nsilent for a moment as she finished stirring the ingredients. After that, Akir\nhelped Blade down to his side so he could expose his hind leg to her. The\nbandages were already soiled from what he could tell as she unspun them from\naround his leg. Deep red splotches darkened the tan fabric.\n\n\"You never did give us your name,\" Blade said.\n\n\"Talia,\" she replied.\n\n\"Thanks, Talia,\" Blade said with a small smile. \"I appreciate what you've done\nfor me, and—AAAAAAH!\" Blade winced and cried out as an intense, stinging pain\ncoursed through his thigh. It felt as if there was a fire burning and melting\nhis flesh all up and down his hind leg. Akir was nearly ready to attack her\nbefore Blade held a paw out to stop him. Though he would never have been able to\nphysically, it was enough for now.\n\n\"It's going to sting,\" she warned much too late.\n\nBlade growled and clenched his teeth tightly, his tail beating the floor and\nstirring up some dust behind him. He rode out the pain for nearly an entire\nminute before the burning sensation subsided and was replaced by a dull ache. He\npanted rapidly, his heart hammering in his chest. Tears streamed from his eyes,\nand his claws had dug grooves in the wooden flooring.\n\n\"Get some rest,\" she said after bandaging his leg with fresh linen. \"Your wing\nis broken and your forearm is fractured. I don't know what I'm going to do about\nyour wing... that's something I've never dealt with before, but I'll get a\nsplint ready for you in the morning.\"\n\nBlade hadn't thought too much about the extent of his injuries. He frowned and\nlooked at Akir, trying to find some hope. He only received a concerned\nexpression back—and that wasn't very reassuring. It was bad enough that Blade\nwouldn't be able to walk right for a while, but he had lost his ability to fly!\nHe had no idea how long it would take for his wing to heal... if it even did.\nWhat if he could never fly again?\n\nTalia led them through her stuffy and crowded house into a spare bedroom with an\nactual bed. Under any other circumstance, Blade would have been overjoyed to be\nsleeping on an actual bed, but with the pain constantly nagging at him, he could\nhardly enjoy it.\n\nHe whined after Talia left them, and Akir immediately—but carefully—hugged Blade\ntightly. Blade felt Akir's wings and arms wrapping around him, feeling a warmth\nrising within him that distracted from the pain. Flashbacks to when they had\nfirst met raced through his mind; he remembered so little of it, but he would\nnever forget what Akir did for him.\n\n\"I'm so sorry I wasn't there,\" Akir said, sniffling. Blade felt his heart nearly\nbreak. Akir blamed himself for his mistake. It was probably eating at him the\nwhole time, but he would never have shown his true emotions in front of anyone\nother than Blade.\n\n\"It's my fault, Akir. You told me not to come here alone...\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Blade,\" he mumbled and pushed his snout firmly into Blade's neck.\nBlade felt himself start to cry. There were only a few times in his life that he\ncould remember Akir breaking down like this, and each of them had been a\nsituation almost as bad as this one. Blade warbled softly and sniffled as he\nsnuggled in against Akir. He knew that Akir cared for him deeply, and now that\nmuch was obvious. Hearing the blue and purple dragon crying over him... that set\nBlade's chest ablaze.\n\n\"I'll get better soon,\" he comforted. \"Promise.\"\n\n* * *\n\nBut to Blade soon felt like an eternity. The days rolled on by slowly. The first\nweek wasn't nearly as bad as the next few. He was too busy dealing with the pain\nto realize how doing nothing all day was really taking a toll on him. When he\nstarted to feel better, he was able to walk around the dusty, old house, but\nthat was it. And even then, he had to stumble around with a splint on his\nforearm. He was stuck there. And more often than not, his only company was the\ncranky old 'ness.\n\nTalia was stricter than any mother Blade had ever imagined. He wasn't allowed to\ndo anything fun or even step outside. She fed him a specific diet to quicken his\nhealing process and kept fresh bandages on his leg. His splint on his forearm\nwas constantly being readjusted so that it would remain tight. She did figure\nout how to fix his wing during the first week. It wasn't as bad of a break as\nshe had thought at first, and it was rather easy to shove into place again. The\npain was excruciating for a few minutes, but it abated and felt much better as\ntime progressed.\n\nSince Blade couldn't go anywhere—without the risk of being attacked again—he had\nto find things to occupy himself. With Akir gone most of the time, he chatted\nwith Talia. The more he got to know her, the more he liked her.\n\n\"So, you two have been on your own for over a decade?\" Talia asked curiously\nwhile she prepared their meals.\n\nBlade nodded while trying to peer over the wooden counter to see what she was\ndoing. It was just at eye-level, making it rather difficult for him to see. Just\nlike most of his meals, there was a mixture of herbs and very little meat. Blade\nhad grown up eating what he could find, so he wasn't a very picky eater—but he\nstill didn't like vegetables!\n\n\"I think I was only a couple months old when Akir found me. He was an orphan\ntoo, but he's almost two years older than I am.\"\n\n\"It's no wonder neither of you two is disciplined,\" she grumbled. \"That's\nimpressive though. I'm surprised the city didn't eat you both up.\"\n\nBlade grinned. \"It wasn't all that hard... Akir did most of the work anyway.\nHe's always protected me and cared for me...\" His thoughts drifted to his older\nbrother, wondering what he was up to now and whether or not he was okay. He had\nbeen gone all day!\n\n\n\n\n\"You're rather fond of that brat, aren't you?\"\n\nBlade stamped his paws in protest. \"He's not a brat! He's very kind and caring\nwhen you get to know him.\"\n\nTalia chuckled and diced up a stalk-like vegetable that Blade hadn't seen\nbefore. \"He does treat you well—better than any real siblings I know of. You\nshould have seen him on your first night here while you were unconscious. He\ncouldn't sit still, he wouldn't stop whining, and he ignored anything I said,\nwhich really isn't any different from now.\"\n\nA soft smile curled Blade's lips as he thought about that. He felt sorry that\nAkir had to go through that, but it warmed his heart to know how much his\nbrother cared for him.\n\n\"What happened to his parents?\"\n\nBlade shrugged his shoulders so he didn't hurt his wings. \"I don't know... he's\nnever told me.\" She sighed and nodded. Blade noticed her expression and\ncomposure change as she slumped down a bit. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Whatever happened must have been pretty bad... I can see it in his eyes.\"\n\nBlade warbled curiously. \"You can? H- How?\" He felt a sense of uncertainty as he\nthought about what really did happen to Akir's family... He wondered if it had\nscarred him deeply. Unlike Akir, Blade didn't know his family. He didn't\nremember very much during his hatchling years. All he really remembered was that\ncold, rainy night when Akir saved him, and the rest was a blur up until he was a\ndragonet.\n\nBlade had always wondered about his parents: who they were, what they looked\nlike, where they were. But he mostly wondered why they had abandoned him. Surely\nthere must have been a good reason... but Akir always told him not to think or\nworry about it. They were gone.\n\n\"It's something you pick up as you get older,\" she replied. \"You see a lot of\ninjured people when you're a healer, and sometimes you know that there are\nwounds you just can't heal.\"\n\nBlade nodded and worried even more about Akir. \"C- Can you teach me how to see\nthat stuff?\" He thought that having that sort of knowledge would be useful. He\nliked talking to people and understanding them, so being able to read them\nbetter would be very useful!\n\nTalia glanced at him thoughtfully. \"I don't know. You don't seem all that\nstupid, I suppose,\" she teased. \"But it's something that will take years to\nlearn, and even longer to understand what you're seeing.\"\n\n\"I'm really smart! I learn things quickly, according to Akir,\" he said and\nnodded as if to assure her it was true.\n\n\"We'll see where it goes.\"\n\nBlade wiggled happily. \"I'll do my best!\"\n\n* * *\n\nFor the next month or two, Talia taught Blade a lot about how people work: their\nexpressions, body language, emotions, and how to read all of that. It wasn't too\nhard for Blade to pick up on, but he didn't have the chance to see how other\nspecies are different. Although he and Talia were anatomically different, they\nwere both still dragons. It was very easy to read her basic expressions.\n\nShe also taught him about how the world works. Blade never realized all of the\nlittle intricacies that occurred in everyday life, and she opened his eyes to a\nlot of it. And listening to all of it made him very eager to get out of there!\n\nAfter nearly two months had passed, Blade's wing had healed. He and Akir went to\ntest his wing outside the city wall. Talia's house was rather close to it, so\nall they had to do was hop on top of the roofs and onto the wall before they\ncould glide down on the other side of it.\n\nBlade climbed into the air and extended his wings fully as he glided in a\ncircle. He felt the warm sun at his back, making his outstretched wings feel\nlike they were glowing. The wind brushed against his sleek feathers and pinned\nthem to his body.\n\nBlade had never missed flying so much in his life! He soared high in the air and\ndid a few twirls and flips. It didn't hurt, but it did feel a little\nuncomfortable if he had to strain his healed wing. Still, Blade couldn't have\nbeen happier, and Akir seemed to share in his happiness.\n\nEven after Blade had fully healed, the duo stayed at Talia's home. She knew they\nneeded a place to stay, and she enjoyed the company, even if she and Akir didn't\nget along well. Akir was too proud and arrogant, and Talia wasn't one to respect\nthat. Not that she really respected Blade, either, but she treated him better.\n\nTalia continued to teach him all sorts of things while Akir was away. When he\nwasn't, they played together, wrestled with each other, or walked around the\ncity, side by side. They never stole much together anymore; Akir did that on his\ntrips. They didn't have much reason to steal, now that they had Talia's company,\nbut Akir sometimes brought back more supplies for Talia as well as food for all\nof them.\n\nFor a few months, Blade begged Akir to take him along with him when he went out\nduring his trips. Akir always said no and that it was too dangerous, which made\nBlade feel very insignificant. Ever since that incident, he was even more\nprotective of his younger brother—Blade never thought he could get worse! Blade\nfinally convinced him one day, and he was overjoyed to hear that it was a\nmission—a well-paying one. He didn't really know what that meant, but he was\nsuper excited!\n\nBlade followed behind Akir, who confidently stepped around like he owned the\nplace, through the market district of the city. It seemed that the older Akir\ngot, the more arrogant he became, or as he liked to put it, confident.\n\nBlade always felt a lot safer with his older brother. The prying eyes of the\ntwo-legs could almost be felt stabbing into his soul. Blade never felt safe\nalone anymore, and admittedly the two-legs were a little more frightening than\nhe once thought.\n\nVery few times were the two-legs kind to him; Talia was the only nice one he had\nmet. The humans were typically the worst—they were a bunch of uppity pricks—but\neven the dragons, gryphons, wolves, felines, rodents, and whoever else that were\nevolved beasts were also disrespectful to their four-legged brethren. In spite\nof sharing similar appearances, the ferals were outcast to the very outskirts of\ntown to live in segregation in their own district.\n\nBlade tried his best to greet some of the friendlier looking two-legs that\nwatched him and Akir walk past. Despite being relatively kind to everyone he\nmet, Blade was received with stares, glares, and even threats. It wasn't like\nthey were the only ferals walking around, either. The market district was mixed\nwith ferals and two-legs of all species. Despite Talia's teachings, Blade never\nunderstood why everyone couldn't get along, but Akir explained that it was just\nhow the entire world was. Akir never seemed to mind being an outcast. Unlike\nBlade, he was confident in himself.\n\nAkir was everything Blade wanted to be: strong, confident, smart, and\ncharismatic. He was very handsome too! His brilliant, sapphire-scaled hide was\nspeckled with splotches of dark-purple that mostly gathered close to his spine\nfrom his head to his tail. He was adorned with two pairs of black horns, the\nlarger and longer pair atop the other. Only one forepaw of his was painted\ndark-purple while the rest were the same color as the rest of his hide. Just the\ntip of his snout was purple, too, from his nose to his chin.\n\nBlade was a rare species as far as he could tell. There were very few dragons\nthat shared his feathered hide, as he had only ever seen a pawful in his life,\nbut deep down he liked feeling special!\n\nThe majority of Blade's feathered hide was a solid black, but the rest was a\nbright gold. After his feathered crest, a golden mane of tiny, long, delicate\nfeathers traced down his neck to the tip of his tail. His underbelly, from the\nbase of his neck to the tip of his tail, was covered in golden feathers. They\nwere the fluffiest at his chest, often poofing out when he didn't mean for them\nto.\n\nOn each of his forearms at his wrists was a pair of golden bracelets that looked\nto be painted on his feathers. The bases of his forepaws were golden as well as\nboth of his hind paws up to his thighs. His shoulders around his wing joints had\na unique, swirly golden design etched into his black feathers. It was the same\naround his rear end and at the top of his feathered wings. Speckling his black,\nfeathered wings was the occasional golden feather that stood out amongst the\ndarkness of his hide.\n\nAkir often complimented Blade on his appearance, which made him feel giddy\ninside. It wasn't rare for Akir to make a nice comment about Blade, but more\noften than not he was too busy being worried about him. Being the bigger and\nstronger dragon, Akir felt like he had to be the protective older brother. Even\nnow, that much was evident.\n\nAkir tensed up as a column of guards entered the street a few blocks ahead of\nthem. He looked quickly back at Blade and pointed with a wing to an alleyway on\ntheir right. They quickly ducked in, walking single-file since it wasn't wide\nenough for the both of them.\n\n\"I told you not to bring attention to us!\" Akir hissed at Blade, taking a left\nturn down another backstreet.\n\n\"You're the one flaunting yourself around!\" Blade retorted. \"I only said hello\nto some people...\"\n\n\"This isn't the feral district, Blade. We need to keep on the down-low; people\nare starting to recognize us now.\"\n\nBlade sighed and nodded as continued to follow Akir through a familiar path that\nweaved around the market district and put them closer to the palace district. It\nwas a much longer path than walking straight through the streets, but it was\nmost certainly safer hiding in the shadows.\n\nAfter many years of living and stealing in the city, Blade and Akir had slowly\naccumulated an infamous reputation, though no one really knew it was them.\nHaving followed Akir's plans, they kept their identities hidden rather well.\nTheir disappearance for several months helped a lot to disguise their trail. The\nclosest description they had on their wanted posters was \"two feral dragons.\"\nEven so, that put most citizens at unease, but mostly because they were ferals.\nFerals were always up to no good, according to any two-leg ever.\n\nThey took another left turn, and they were soon back out on the main street.\nSuccessfully, they circumvented the small column of guards and were able to\ncontinue the rest of the way to the palace district's gates unhindered.\n\n\"So, why are we getting here so early?\" Blade asked a bit loudly.\n\nAkir glanced at him and bared a small snarl to say, shut it!\n\nBlade shrunk back and nodded. They approached the palace district's gates, where\nthere were four guards posted on either side of it. Blade felt a little nervous,\nbut Akir caressed his cheek reassuringly with his tail and flashed a smile at\nhim.\n\n\"I'll go first. Wait a few minutes and then go. I'll be waiting for you.\"\n\nBlade grinned back and nodded. He casually walked over to a bench to sit down on\nand watched Akir pass the guards alone. He sat sejant on the wooden bench with\nhis tail curled around his paws. He looked around at the different faces,\nsnouts, and beaks mixed in with the crowd. Mostly humans walked through the\ngate, but there were some well-dressed two-legs as well that could afford to\nlive there.\n\nThe palace district was the only district to have a wall completely separating\nit from the rest of the districts. Blade tried to imagine what it would be like\nto live there, and he wondered if it was even possible for a four-leg to become\nrich enough to afford it. Even then, he wondered if a feral would be allowed\nlive there, seeing how the majority of two-legs and humans despised them.\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes, Blade walked through the gate and met Akir after\nturning around a building. Akir licked and nuzzled him, glad that nothing\nhappened. They continued on their way down a cobblestone street.\n\nThe palace district was beautiful. There were gardens everywhere with plants\nthat thrived on the water given to them by caretakers, bringing an explosion of\ncolor to his eyes. It was like an immediate change of environment, an oasis in\nthe middle of a desert. The buildings were mostly constructed of solid granite\nand marble, and the architecture was elegant. The actual palace where the king\nstayed was the largest building Blade had ever seen, and it was located at the\nvery center of the city. Even from here the feral district it could be seen, its\nspires towering above the other buildings.\n\n\"This place is beautiful, Akir.\"\n\nAkir chuckled at Blade's amusement and nodded. \"It certainly is. It would be a\ngold mine if it weren't for all of the guards around.\"\n\n\"I wish we could live here,\" he said wistfully.\n\nAkir shook his head along with a growl of disapproval. \"I'd much rather be with\nmy own kind than live here.\"\n\nBlade sighed and watched as a little rodent darted up a lone tree.\n\nBlade had rarely visited the palace district before. Ferals weren't very welcome\nhere, but they surprisingly weren't outlawed, though flying was. There were too\nmany incidents with break-ins, so if anyone was caught flying over the district,\nthey would be shot down. This was the district where the wealthiest families\nlived, mostly noble lords and ladies. Neither Blade nor Akir had any money to\ntheir name—at least they didn't today!\n\nAkir led Blade through the back of a home that looked to be abandoned, and sure\nenough it was. They slipped in through the back, finding a window on the third\nstory that was missing its glass. It wasn't hard for them to climb up the\nbuilding, as it had multiple levels and roofs to jump up on. And if they really\nneeded to, they could have flown into it, if they were careful not to get\nspotted.\n\nInside, the room was left bare. Their claws clacked on the hardwood floor as\nthey inspected the area half-mindedly. It was very dusty in here, and it tickled\nBlade's nose unpleasantly.\n\n\"We couldn't have waited until later?\" Blade grumbled, twitching his nose.\n\nAkir shook his head. \"In about an hour, those gates will close. If we're caught\nin this district after that, we'll probably be killed. We'll wait in here until\nit's dark out; then we'll make our move.\"\n\n\"If we're waiting until it's dark, we could have flown down,\" Blade offered.\n\n\"Too risky. They have some sort of spell now that detects anything above a\ncertain height.\"\n\nBlade sighed and dusted off a spot for him to lie down. He didn't like his\nfeathers getting all dusty or dirty. \"This had better be worth it!\"\n\nAkir grinned toothily and nuzzled Blade. He flopped down beside the younger\ndrake and nodded. \"It is! The gem we're after is worth over five-hundred gold\npieces, and I've already got a buyer for that much.\"\n\nBlade's ears perked up. \"Five-hundred!?\"\n\nAkir hissed, \"Keep your voice down.\"\n\nBlade meeped and gulped, his eyes wide. He lowered his voice. \"That's a lot of\nmoney... What would we even do with it?\"\n\nA warm smile curled Akir's lips. \"We're going to buy our first home!\"\n\nBlade grinned giddily back. They haven't had a real home since... ever! The\nclosest they've had was an abandoned mine shaft beneath the city, but that had\nonly lasted a year or two before it became too dangerous to live in. Now, they\nlived with the old dragoness Talia. Even though it was the most comfortable\nplace they had ever stayed, it wasn't anything like having their own home!\n\n\"What's the plan?\" he asked, eager to help out and begin their mission.\n\nAkir pointed with a black claw at the floor in front of them, pretending to be\ndrawing a map. \"We're currently here, so we'll have to sneak out and make our\nway all the way over here,\" he said, scraping his claw along the wood. \"We'll\nhave to keep an eye out because there are four groups of patrolling guards for\neach sector of this district. We'll break in through the back again of a\nbuilding similar to this one. There is a large garden behind it, so sneaking\nonto their property should be easy.\"\n\nBlade nodded and stored the information away for later. \"Do you know where the\ngem is?\"\n\n\"That's the tricky part... It's in a lady's necklace that she wears every day.\nWe'll probably have to break in to her bedroom, snatch the necklace, and get out\nbefore they call the guards... or worse.\"\n\nBlade gulped. \"Worse?\"\n\n\"If they retaliate, try not to hurt them.\"\n\nBlade nodded. He and Akir may have been thieves, but they were not killers.\n\n* * *\n\nA few hours later, the sun dropped behind the horizon and left the desert city\nin darkness. As Blade and Akir crouched down and prowled briskly from house to\nhouse, cover to cover, the cool night air welcomed them. They snuck passed one\nof the patrols and waited out the other on their way to their target.\n\nOnce they had arrived, they looked around quietly for an easy entrance. Blade\nfound a window that could open on the first of two stories, and it was left\nunlocked. He picked at it with his claws, opened the latch, and he squeezed in.\nIt was too tight of a fit for Akir, so Blade circled back and opened the back\ndoor for him.\n\nUnlike their hideout earlier, this house was filled with furniture and\ndecorations, many of which Blade wanted to steal. But he couldn't fit\neverything, and they were here for a specific objective anyway: the necklace.\nThey carefully padded through the house, making sure not to bump into or knock\nanything over, since it was rather cramped inside for two feral dragons.\n\n\"Stay down here while I go up the stairs,\" Akir whispered, \"Look for the\nbedroom... and grab anything else that will fit in your satchel.\"\n\nBlade nodded dutifully and searched around. He opened a door slowly and peeked\ninside to see if there was anyone there. He could feel his heart thudding in his\nchest until he elicited a small sigh of relief. Blade hated to admit it, but he\nwas nervous. He didn't want to disappoint Akir, and he didn't want to ruin the\nopportunity they had for a better life.\n\nHe searched the bedroom and did happen to find a few pieces of jewelry lying\naround, though they didn't look like anything important. He shoved them in his\nsatchel and moved on to the next room. This time the door creaked and made Blade\nflinch. He peeked inside and saw a little, gryphon girl lying on her bed. He\nimmediately pulled the door closed and latched the bar shut. He quietly stepped\naway and about knocked down a vase with his tail. He quickly whirled around to\ncatch it and readjust it, but in that process his tail smacked against a wooden\npost and made a thud.\n\nBlade froze for a few moments and then sighed with relief. He shook his head and\ntried to calm his fluttering heart. Once he did, he heard a loud thud, a clash,\nand then another loud thud from upstairs. Again, Blade's heart raced, but so did\nhis legs. He rushed up the staircase and hurried after Akir. When he reached the\ntop, he saw the purple and blue dragon sprinting toward him from down the long\nhall.\n\n\"Run! I got it!\" he shouted.\n\nBlade nodded. Before he turned around, he saw a very angry, gryphon father\nchasing after them with a sword. Blade yelped and slid down the stairs and\ndarted for the back door with Akir close behind. They broke free from the home,\nbounded out into the garden, and took off into the sky. They flew right over the\nwall, swiftly swooping over some guards, and then climbed into the skies.\n\nAs Blade looked behind them, he saw the house fading away as they gained\ndistance. He giggled happily and did a little twirl in the air. Akir grinned\ntoothily at him and bellowed a magnificent roar that echoed through the\ndarkness. Blade shivered at that. Rarely did he ever hear Akir roar, and even\nmore rarely was it a joyful roar!\n"
